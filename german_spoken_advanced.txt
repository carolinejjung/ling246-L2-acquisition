so in the video is Charlie Chaplin who uh walks through a street and people throw their trash out of the window and in the corner of the street he finds a baby and he tries to find the mother of the baby and then a woman walks by and she and he thinks that it’s her baby and tries to give it back to her and she tells him that it was not her baby and is kind of mad with him so he takes the bay back and tries to put it back into the corner and a police officer walks by and / asks him why he put the baby there and to take it back he takes it back and uh walks down another street and there’s a man and he tries to give it to a man while he pretends that he wants to do with something with his shoes and when he runs away the man that has the baby sees the woman with the other baby and tries to give it to her again and I think by innocent uh Charlie Chaplin walks by the woman again and she sees him and runs after him to give the baby back to him and he takes it back and  / sits down on uh the street and he like a= analysis the baby and finds a little card where someone asked him to love ‘n’ carry the baby and there the video ends by him just like having the baby in his arms and smiling to him / ‘n’ that’s it
uh in the clip Charlie Chaplin walks down a dirty road where lots of rubble falls down also hits him uh he’s quite angry about the situation in the street uh lits a cigarette to calm himself down probably afterwards he finds a baby covered in blankets in a corner he picks the baby up uh / thinks about what to do with the baby and where the baby belongs to when a woman crossed his road and he recognises the woman and sees her she’s also carrying another baby and she thinks that he thinks that the baby g= belongs to the woman so he places the baby he found  next to her baby when the woman recognizes this she gets angry about Charlie Chaplin and / also hits him and shouts at him probably so he takes the baby and runs away / then he tries to put the baby back into the corner where he found it but a police officer watches him so he runs away from the officer with the baby / then he crosses or meets an old man and he gives the baby to the man and / pretends to tie his shoes when the man holds the baby he just gets up and run away and hhh the old man whose got the baby now also runs away with the baby and tries to follow Charlie Chaplin who hides in a house then the old man also sees the woman with the other baby and puts the f= baby who was found in the corner next to the baby of the woman uh and runs away again then Charlie Chaplin meets the woman another time who sees the baby in her next to her baby and gets angry another time and hits Charlie Chaplin another time who takes the baby again and runs away with the baby / uh / then he sits down on a / s= on the side of the street and thinks about what to do with the baby right now whether he should place it just next to the street then he finds a small piece of paper inside the blankets of the baby which says that this baby is an orphan and needs someone to care about uh care take care of the baby ‘n’ then he just takes the baby smiles and goes away with the baby in his arm
in the video you can see a man walking down the road and a woman throwing out rubbish out of her window when he’s hit by rubbish for the second time he comes to a halt and takes out a cigarette / after that he sees a child lying on the ground and picks it up then in the background you can see a woman walking down the road with her stroller and an other baby in the stroller so he thinks that it’s a good idea to put the baby that he found into the stroller but after he does that the woman argues with him that it is not her child and he takes the baby back then he wants to put the baby back to the place where he found it but he encounters a police man so he picks up the baby and leaves the place in the next scene scene he meets an old man and gives the baby to him and runs away then he hides and the old man passes a shop where he sees a stroller and puts the baby into that stroller the stroller is the one that the man put the baby in before so in the next scene you can see the man passing the stroller and the woman that owns the stroller coming out of a shop and sees the man passing the stroller and he sees the other baby in her stroller so the woman follows him and is punching him with an umbrella you can also see a policeman coming to the scene so the man needs to take the baby again he walks away ‘n’ then he sits down on the side walk and then he opens the blanket in which the baby is covered and he finds a note saying that this child is an orphan and the child needs someone to love ‘n’ in the end of the scene you can see the m=man leaving with the baby
okay in this video I can see Charlie Chaplin who walks through his street uh the streets are dusty and the houses appear a bit fragile because every time uh e= every time he passes the houses some things fall down uh / yeah and he always uh passage outside because he doesn’t want to be hit by things uh uh someti= some= after a a while he reaches a place where a dustbin stands and behind one of these dustbins he finds a little baby uh at first it seems that somebody has dropped the baby especially a woman who has a push chair with another baby inside so he decides to go to the woman and tell her that she lost the child but the woman didn’t doesn’t want to believe him and appeared a bit angry she might assume that it’s not her child because uh he wants to get rid of it so I think that he wants to make xxx to care for the child so Cha=Chaplin takes the child back and goes goes ‘n’ leaves the woman alone and wants to bring the child back to where he found it but then meets a policeman and he uh / actually xxx Charlie Chaplin who takes the child back and tries to give it to the man with the walking stick and uh then he gives it really to the man and puts it in his arms and escapes from the situation but the man doesn’t want to hurt the child either and he puts it back into the woman’s care but then the woman discovers that the child that he xxx Charlie Chaplin xxx and forces him to to take the child back and she also calls the policeman with xxx Charlie Chaplin take the child back and goes away and then he sits on the street and considers to throw the child in a gully but then he stops and now looks in the child’s xxx please care ‘n’ love this orphan child he feels sorry for the child xxx and he decides to care for the child xxx
okay the video was about uh the figure or the person Charlie Chaplin uh I think he was a comedian and it’s about uh the story that he finds a child on the street and uh he picks it up but he doesn’t know what to do with it so he tries to get rid of it in several ways for example he tries to uh hand it over to a woman but uh she obviously doesn’t wan’it uh so so she gives it back to him and so on and he tries to hand it over to a man but he uh also gives it back to him so he ends up with this child and uh at one point he also thinks about dropping it down a drain but then he’s like nah better not do it and then uh he finds a a letter uh which is uh like the child is put into a blanket and he finds it in his blanket and on this letter there is hhh a message saying that uh this is an orphan and someone should uh take care of it ‘n’ love it and uh yeah that’s basically it
okay uh the scene of Charlie Chaplin is about a man who obviously is Charlie Chaplin and he finds a baby and he tries everything to get rid of this baby and yeah in the end he keeps the baby so uh first in the scene we see how Charlie Chaplin goes into an alley where he finds a baby that uh is placed uh next to a bin and uh he immediately takes the baby into his arms and uh when he sees a woman dri= uh going by with uh / when he sees a woman going by he uh tries to uh put the baby into the pacifiered she is uh a paci= pacifier uh was it what was the word again to the uh in the to the carriage uh the kid's carriage and tries to put uh the baby inside but the woman immediately uh is outraged and gives him the baby back and then he tries= he goes back to where he found the baby and tries to put it down there again but uh an officer an police officer who uh sees him notice that he's uh putting the baby back uh  / but yeah notice him and then Charlie Chaplin sees them and uh takes the baby with him and uh then when he goes other side of the alley he sees an old man with a walking stick and and gives him the baby and runs uh runs away and the old man then sees again the same woman with a carriage baby carriage and uh gives her the baby and uh the woman doesn't really notice the old man so when Charlie Chaplin goes by she thinks that it was him and gives him the baby back then uh Charlie Chaplin he uh yeah and th= then th= the officer also comes and uh Charlie Chaplin has baby and then uh he goes away again and sits down on the uh on the pavement and he then uh / he then looks kinda like he wants to give up and then he then he notices a paper a folded paper in the uh in the baby uh in the hhh uh in the blanket the baby is wrapped in and takes out the paper ‘n’ reads that ‘n’ there's a sentence there that says that the person who finds a baby should uh take care and give love to this orphan child and uh then he decides to keep the baby and then he goes goes away again with the baby
okay so there's Charlie walking down the street uh smoking ‘n’ he gets hit by trash and his cigarette falls on the floor ‘n’ then he wants to smoke another cigarette and in between the trash cans uh or by the trash cans he finds a baby hhh and picks it up ‘n’ is checking everywhere if he sees uh a mother or family ‘n’ then a woman walks by with a stroller and a baby in it ‘n’ he assumes that it's her baby so he puts the baby in the stroller ‘n’ the woman comes out of a shop and uh is angry and saying that it's not her child so Charlie is hhh uh walking with away with the child again and wants to drop it uh where he found it ‘n’ then a police officer comes and sees everything so Charlie picks the baby up again and uh hhh is uh carrying on ‘n’ then uh there's an old man Charlie pretends to uh he wants to tie his shoes uh and gives the baby to the old man ‘n’ runs away ‘n’ hides and uh the old man is searching for Charlie finds the stroller of the woman Charlie met before ‘n’ puts the baby in it and uh hhh because Charlie s= sees the police officer again he walks different way and walks past the stroller and the woman sees him and the baby in her stroller and uh hits him with the with her umbrella and uh hhh Charlie has to tak= and the police officer comes as well ‘n’ so Charlie takes the baby ‘n’ walks away and uh sits down on the street ‘n’ finds a note where it says that uh the baby should be loved ‘n’ cared for ‘n’ it and it's an orphan child I think and uh Charlie looks at the baby and yeah goes away with it
the movie clip shown to me showed uh a black and white film with a man as a main character presumably it was Charlie Chaplin with who can be uh / who can be uh which we can see because of his iconic hat and uh walking stick and his suit and uh the clip shows how Charlie Chaplin / finds a baby when he's lighting his cigarette like standing in an alleyway and uh in the movie club it's shown how he tries to get rid of the baby in a comical way for example in the beginning he starts uh walking towards a carriage that has a baby in it and then uh tells the mother presumably the mother th= the woman standing next to the carriage that she has dropped something and he's indicating to the baby he has found uh and she / reacts in a very hhh in a very / mad way and uh starts shouting at him so then he has to take the baby back so ‘n’ then he decides decides to just put the baby back uh on the ground where he found it when a police officer comes coming by is coming by and uh sees it and presumably thinks that he is trying to get rid of his own baby so uh Charlie Chaplin has to take the baby uh in his arms again and uh in the next situation a very old man uh walking with a walking crane is shown and uh Charlie indicates that he has to uh he's holding the baby in his arms and he indicates that he has to fix his shoelaces so he gives the baby to the old man for him to hold it and uh after he gave the baby after he gives the baby to the man he runs off so the old man because he can't walk properly uh can't follow him quickly enough so that uh when he turns around a corner he sees a carriage ‘n’ he puts the baby in there to get rid of it uh and the carriage was standing or is standing in front of a shop and there's no uh adult beneath it uh besides it but in the next uh scene we can see that the woman that it's the woman that Charlie Chaplin has met before so uh when Charlie in the next scene is walking uh past the carriage the woman recognizes him and sees a baby in her carriage and uh thinks that he has dropped the baby again like uh the foreign baby into her baby's carriage and she starts shouting and screaming and hitting him hhh violently uh so the police officer that has seen Charlie Chaplin trying to get rid of the baby uh sees all this and it caused cau= caught his eye so he goes in uh to the scene to try to understand what is happening and the woman explains it so Charlie e= explains the situation to him so ‘n’ then Charlie has no other uh op= no other way out than taking the baby and the last scene is him sitting down on like uh on the street with the baby in his hand and underneath him he sees a uh / like a / street xxx a canalization uh / lid and uh he opens it and indicates to throw the baby into the canalization but then after taking a look at the baby's face he decides against it and uh he takes it into his arm / and wants to go off and then he finds a letter uh attached to the baby ‘n’ that says that the baby wants or needs to be loved
uh okay so in the video we can see a man who seems to be a little clumsy and I do believe he's Mr. Chaplin uh he's walking along a street and he nearly gets it with things from I don't know like constru= construction site uh so then he likes to smoke he smokes two or three cigarettes uh and when he puts off his cigarette he actually sees a little baby on the street and he picks it up and it's screaming and he doesn't really know what to do with it and he sees an old lady and he tries to put it with her uh but she doesn't like it doesn't seem to be really her child so she screams at him and he takes back the baby when he then tries to put it back down on the floor where he found the baby he gets caught by a police officer and so he takes it back up uh I believe next he's trying to give it to an old man uh but the old man then also tries to give it to the lady and he then runs away so when Mr. Chaplin walks by the lady the lady sees him and thinks well he wanted to give her the child again so she yells at him and the police xxx officer comes and he's also yelling at them so they're having a discussion so at the end Mr. Chaplin takes the baby and they sit down uh on the concrete of the street and he tries well he's starting to play with the baby and he finds a little letter saying that it's an orphan child and that someone whoever finds it please should take care of the baby and then he walks up with the baby
hhh in the beginning we see Charlie Chaplin uh walking around in an what appears to be an industrial area uh when he wants to light up a cigarette uh he finds a baby lying on the floor uh / he then uh sees a woman in the background running around with a baby wagon he then assumes that the baby belongs to the uh to the to the woman with the baby wagon and uh just drops it off uh the baby actually does not  belong to the woman and uh yeah she forces uh the baby more or less out of the bab= baby wagon onto Charlie Chaplin once more uh yeah he then wants to drop the kid off to on the ground but uh yeah a nearby police officer stops him from doing that and uh yeah Chaplin walks around with the with the kid yeah not knowing what to do with it uh when he sees another man he then pretends that he has something on his shoe and that he wants to clean it and therefore the man has to take care of the child for for a second uh yeah but when he hands uh the the child to the man he just runs away hhh uh yeah in the next sequence we see the man uh dropping the the child off uh into the baby wagon of the of the women that we have seen in the in the first sequence as well uh to just to get rid of it uh yeah meanwhile uh Chaplin walks by once more on the street uh and yeah the woman uh assumes that Chaplin uh it was Chaplin who dropped off the the baby once more into the baby wagon and then uh yeah more or less beats him up uh forces the baby onto him once more uh yeah then uh Charlie Chaplin uh walks around uh yeah looking a bit cluelessly uh sits down on the ground and uh he then finds finds a note uh that that came with the with the baby and the note says uh please take care and love this orphan child hhh yeah uh the short film ends uh with Charlie Chaplin uh standing up still holding the the baby but looking a bit more happy so it looks like he he now wants to take care of the baby
okay uh so Charles Chaplin is a middle-aged man wearing something like an old-fashioned uh suit or smoking and a melon hat and he's just about to uh glim his cigarette uh when he finds a baby on the streets uh ‘n’ then he sees a woman who is sure of that she might be the mother of the child uh but when he uh asks her or brings a child to her uh he realizes that she isn't obvious she's obviously not the mother and she kind of freaks out ‘n’ then he's not sure what to do so he uh lays the child back on the street and uh hhh then a police officer sees him and uh tells him that he can't uh let this child alone on the street so uh he takes the child again and brings it to an uh another man and then he pretends like uh his shoe’s open uh and in this second he runs away so uh the man uh is or the other man is alone with a child uh hhh and then the man sees the same woman as Charles Chaplin did uh so uh he brings the child to this woman uh and when the woman then sees Charles Chaplin again she kind of freaks out again hhh and so he uh yeah takes the child with him and sits down on the pavement and when he is uh looking at the child he founds a letter in the uh duvet of the child uh and then he sees that this child is an orphan child and he or someone is looking for someone who can take care of the child and love it
so in the video uh the kid from Charlie Chap= Chaplin a man walks down an alley and some things are dropped off a building he keeps on walking ‘n’ stops at a little corner where more things are dropped uh some of that falls on him then he lights himself a cigarette hhh using a shoe uh looking to the side he finds a a child picks it up uh then a woman walks by with her child he follows her ‘n’ puts the child he found at the corner next to the barrels uh in the carriage the woman comes out of the building where she went in before uh and is angry with him saying uh and then he says pardon you dropped something then she angrily tells him to pick up the child ‘n’ he almost takes the wrong child uh she is really angry with him after that and he takes the right child goes back to the corner where he found the little human being and puts it back in that moment a police off= police officer walks by and tells him to pick up his child he does so and walks to a different alley that's where he finds another man ‘n’ he tells him that he has to tie a shoe so the man takes a child and the man uh runs away in the next scene we see a different alley rather uh more a main street UH and the man who now has the child sees the carriage and puts the child in uh and walks away then Charlie Chaplin which I suppose is the man with the head from the beginning uh was hiding in a shed in the meantime walks by and in that moment the woman comes out of the shop and sees him follows him rather runs after him and hits him with her umbrella until he gets back to the carriage to pick up the child uh he does so but only because the policeman who we've seen before in the video uh comes by and demands that he does so then he sits down at a sidewalk uh finds a note in the children's clothes which says please take care ‘n’ love this orphan child ‘n’ then he smiles takes the baby closer to himself and walks away with the child
yes first you see Charlie Chaplin walking down an alley uh where stuff gets thrown down from the upper living rooms uh then he’ll light a stump of a cigarette uh already used up cigarette and he’ll sees a baby uh next to a garbage bin or something and he tries to f= figure out who it belongs to so he starts walking around uh but at xxx he’s doesn’t want to takes res= responsibility to take care of a child so the= he wants to to leave it again but when the policeman comes hhh he uh doesn’t not want to look like a culprit so he has to take care of the baby again so he leaves uh leaves with a woman with another baby when he sees her coming by maybe because he thinks she can already took care of one baby she’ll so must be her baby as well uh but she gets angry and tells him to takes baby again with him uh so he tries to find another way to get kind of rid of a baby without hurting it so uh he finds another man who looks like he has issues with walking so he give gives the baby to the man and then walk= uh pretends to tie his shoes and then walks away but uh this doesn’t work either because the man he gave the baby to uh finds a woman with a b= uh child from the first uh scene before and uh he gets the same sort as Charlie Chaplin putting the baby simply in the with the other one but uh then the mother comes back and notices again that this baby is in her cart and she gets angry at Charlie Chaplin when he walks by because she thinks that he must have been it again uh she hits him several times with her umbrella and the policeman comes by too again so Charlie Chaplin has again a responsibility to take care of the child and later on he’s sitting on the side of the street and he even thinks about throwing the baby in the sewage but he knows that he can’t do it he uh is too good hearted to just leave the baby but he also does not want the responsibility of the baby but then he finds out that the baby is carrying a letter which was kinda hard to read uh but it says something about uh the child being an orphan so in the end he uh went off with with a child taking care of it
okay so first of all the scene starts in black and white and keeps on being in black and white as well Cha= Cha= Charles Chaplin uh rumbles out of a building and finds himself on the street uh he walks down the street and finds a baby on the ground uh the baby seems to be without any care there's no parents around it or anything so he picks it up uh and doesn't really know what to do with it so the first thing he does he tries to put it in another child wagon uh but the mother doesn't want him to so uh she tells him to take the baby back uh his next attempt to get rid of the baby is uh when he tries to just put it on the ground but the police officer finds him and tells him not to do that so he put he takes it back and his next attempt is a little bit more successful when he tries to put it into the arms of another man the other man uh on the other hand he puts it back into the child wagon where Charlie Chaplin first tried to put it in and when Charlie Chaplin randomly ran past the street the mother came back and saw him running so she caught him up and put the baby back into his arms so he was again with the baby uh and the last thing is when he sits on the ground ‘n’ thinks of even putting it into uh just somewhere in the streets uh he he reads a card uh where you can read letters uh please love and care for this child and in this moment he starts to get attached to the child and maybe even sees his destiny in becoming a father to the child / yeah that's it
uh a man walks along a street where thra= uh trash gets thrown out of the window and he gets hit by some trash after that he lights the rest of a cigar and looks around ‘n’ sees a baby and he thinks somebody lost this baby a mother with a wagon for children uh walks by and he runs to her saying you dropped something and tries to hand the baby to her but it isn't hers so he has to walk along with the baby and hhh tries to put it back to the trash cans but he's stopped by a policeman and is taking up the baby walking along the streets again where he mee= meets another old man and asks him to hold the baby while he ties his shoes and while the old man holds the baby he's running away to hide and get lost of the baby / but unfortunately uh the old man finds the same mother again with the wagon with the other child in it and the old man / puts the baby in the wagon and after that uh the / actor walks by and the mother sees him and / thinks he wanted to put the baby again in her child wagon but uh and he for= she forces him to take it back in cooperation with the policeman while he's walking along the street again after that with the baby he sits down on the sidewalk and thinks about dropping the baby in the sewer but uh he / stops this idea and finds a letter in the baby's cushion and it says please love and care for this orphan child
uh in the video you can see Charles Chaplin walking down like a filthy street and where people literally throw out trash out of the balcony and he is uh not happy about the situation when he tries to lit a cigarette and while he walks he finds a little a baby near a dumping right next to the dumpster and he takes the baby and seeing a woman uh walking down the street and with the stroller with the baby in it he just assumes that the baby fell out of that stroller which causes for the person a comedic effect of this rather sad situation that a baby was left on the dumpster and uh after putting the baby in the stroller he said you dropped something and even assumes that he did something nice for the lady and then he tips his hat like and saying you're welcome and but the woman is not happy about that she uh t= tells him to take the baby and is uh rather aggressive about it and uh really desperately he decides to take the baby back to where he found it and but the police officer xxx back and without uh even arguing or without even uh trying to explain xxx he take the baby like he’s trying to uh do something right which is uh interesting because he could have told the police officer that the baby is not his or that he doesn’t know how this baby belongs to but he seems to be so frightened that he just take the baby again uh and in the moment of despair he gives the baby to a total stranger walking down the street and then uh well t= telling him that he has to uh tie his shoe after that uh the man finds the same lady with the same stroller and puts the baby in the place again and he just take off and when Charles Chaplin walks down the same street again the woman sees him and just drags him back down to the stroller and is again really aggressive and very curious about the situation and tells uh him to take the baby and uh then the police officer comes again and uh he has no other option but to take the baby again and when in the last scene when you can see that he’s sitting uh on the sidewalk and he even opens up uh hhh the underground xxx to put the baby down there but uh he decides not to do it he then you know decides uh to look at the baby and notices that there’s a little note and tucked into his clothes that says love and care for this orphan chil= orphan child and this note immediately speaks to him because he decides uh to he looks at the baby he smiles and just gives him a little hug and then he gets up and goes his own way so to say that he accepted the note and that he is going to take care of that orphan child
right so the video begins and you can see Charlie Chaplin walking down a street and something falls from down uh from the windows above him I guess it's bricks or something and uh after that he lights himself a cigarette when he sees a little baby uh lying in the street uh he picks up the baby and he sees a woman with a stroller and he obviously thinks it's her kid so he just puts the kid back in the stroller but the woman makes it very clear that it's not her child so he takes it back and he actually wants to put it back down uh on the floor but then a police officer comes by and uh he makes it clear that Charlie shouldn't put the child on the floor so he picks it up ‘n’ walks away uh when he walks past an elderly man hhh uh he just puts the kid into his arm and runs off and he hides while the elderly man follows him and uh the elderly man also sees the stroller of the woman so he also puts the baby in there ‘n’ walks off uh / after that Charlie again walks past the stroller ‘n’ the woman comes out of the shop and she sees him ‘n’ she obviously thinks that Charlie put the kid back in there so she follows him and makes him take the kid again Charlie then sits down uh with a kid in his arm and he actually finds a little note within uh the kid’s clothes uh which says I think it was please care for this or= please love ‘n’ care for this orphan child after that he walks off with the child with a smile in his face
okay so in the video uh Charlie Chaplin is walking down an uh alley which is uh really s= kind of small ‘n’ dirty ‘n’ some people are uh throwing their trash out of the windows and uh at one point Charlie Chaplin gets hit by some ravish ‘n’ then he stops ‘n’ uh gets a bit angry ‘n’ then he wants to light uh a cigarette and uh while he’s doing so he recognized uh hhh a baby to his left laying on the ground uh which is lonely and he's th= then starts wondering where it’s belonging to hhh and in this moment a woman starts uh is walking by and he then thinks that the baby is belong to her belongs to her and uh so he uh takes the baby and puts uh it in the stroller or baby carriage of the woman but the woman uh is not the mother or s= uh the the woman who is belonging who the baby belongs to s= so she gets really angry uh and she see uh what Chaplin is is doing so uh she tells him tak= to take the baby back uh with him and he uh does so and uh he's not sure what he should do with the baby then and uh thinks of uh putting it back where he found it but uh I think it's a policeman uh is watching him so he takes the baby with him ‘n’ walks away and in the next scene uh he's walking by an old man and uh asking him I think uh to hold the baby for a second so he can uh close his shoes but he's just pretending and as soon as uh the older man has the baby in his arms he uh Chaplin runs away and the other man the older man is uh also not sure what to do with the baby then and uh is walking around and then sees uh a stroller which is the stroller of uh the woman Chaplin met before and he puts the baby in it and walks away and uh when the woman came out of uh the shop or house and sees the other baby in her in her stroller uh she gets really angry and Chaplin was walking by a second before and she's seeing him so she assume that he's responsible for it again and uh yeah walks uh runs through him s= and hits him with an umbrella I think and uh pulls him back to the stroller and uh yeah gets really angry and the policeman is then there again and so Chaplin has to take the baby back with him again and he's walking uh somewhere else and has a baby in his arms ‘n’ is again not sure what to do with the baby he sits down at the ground and then he sees uh that the baby has there was a letter with the baby hhh and in this letter is written that someone should please love and take care of this orphan child so he kind of starts to uh yeah like the baby ‘n’ uh takes it with him again
so in this video Charlie Chaplin is walking down a an alley in a pretty run-down neighborhood people tho= thre= thow trash out of the windows and he gets hit by it and uh then he lights up a cigarette and he's seeing something and it's a baby in blankets on the on the uh on the ground and he at first thinks someone threw it out of the window as well he looks up but there's nothing so he uh picks up the baby and looks around if there's someone who might’ve put it there uh then a woman walks by with a buggy with another child in it and he thinks the baby he found is from her so he puts it in the buggy and uh says pardon madam you lost something and uh but yeah she gets angry because uh the baby isn't from her so uh she gets mad up him mad at him and tells him to take the baby and he takes it again so he takes over buggy uh and walks down the street with it and then he no uh at first he wants to put it back again where he found it and then a police officer walks by at this very moment and tells him that he can’t do that ‘n’ he has to pick the baby up again so he does that and walks down the street and there's a man with a walking cane and he uh asks him to hold the baby for a second so he can tie his shoes uh he pretends to do so and then runs away uh the man obviously because he's uh walking on the cane he can't run after him ‘n’ he also has the child so he uh is also very outraged and uh hhh takes the baby and walks with it and then he also finds the buggy of the woman and f= parked in front of his store the woman is uh inside so he thinks the same and uh or he has the same ideas uh Chaplin had before he puts the baby in the buggy and walks away the woman doesn't notice she just uh leaves the store after and then sees the other baby and at this very moment Chaplin who has hidden before comes by and uh / she sees it she she she sees him and uh obviously thinks that he put the baby in the buggy again and uh / the police officer is also there he comes by and she tells him and / the police officer also saw him before as I already said so uh he also thinks it's his baby and he makes him take the baby basically before that he also gets hit by the woman with her umbrella and uh then he takes the baby and he sits on the uh on the footpath and he's he doesn't know what to do at first like he opens the the drain and maybe thinks for a second to put the baby in there but of course he he wouldn't do that so uh hhh he's taking closer look at the baby ‘n’ the blankets and he f= he finds a note and the note says uh lo= please love and take care of this orphan baby and apparently after reading this note he decides to do that and takes the baby with him
okay so uh we see a man walking through a city / and / he stumbles upon an abandoned child / he picks up the child ‘n’ tries to look for anyone responsible maybe a parent / in the area / turning around he sees a woman with a stroller with another child inside / and he thinks that maybe she would be the mother / he walks up to the mother who / goes inside of a building / ‘n’ so he puts the child inside of the stroller / before he / goes to leave / the mother comes outside / and says it is not her child and he has to take it back / so he takes the child back ‘n’ tries to put it back where he found it / but a policeman / uh sees this / so he picks it back up / and walks away / the policeman is constantly following him / hhh ‘n’ then he finds an older man / and under the pretends of / uh having to tie up his shoes / he uh hands over the child hhh / and but doesn’t take it back / instead he runs away / and / that older man then tries to find someone responsible / and he finds the same stroller with the with the child inside and / but without the mother again / hhh so he puts that child inside and / then / hhh / uh / uh / I forgot the connection uh / uh ‘n’ then at uh at one point / the first man walks down the street / and / previously so uh that the mother sees that the child is inside but / uh / then he sees uh she sees the man walking down the street again ‘n’ thinks he had put it inside again / the policeman is close by so she stops the man / uh beats him up hhh and takes him back to the stroller saying / he had put it ha= had put the child back inside / then she put uh stops the policeman / says oh this man / has put this child in my stroller / but it’s not my child / they both uh / force him to take it back / hhh so he takes it back / he walks / to / close uh by street ‘n’ sits down / in the corner of the uh sidewalk / ‘n’ then he looks through the child’s clothing / inside he finds a note / that says / please love and care for this orphan child / and his attitude towards giving it away changes and he smiles and / walks away / with the child
okay so in the video uh Chaplin walks down a street I think then he sees a baby and he he contemplates what who the baby belongs to and who uh whose baby it is then he picks it up and / I think then he sees a stroller and then he puts the baby into the stroller uh of a of a woman and / the woman sees this and obviously it's not her baby so she tells him I think she I mean obviously it's it's uh a lot of voice but I think she tells him to to get it out again so he does and then he puts it back where he found the baby uh in that minute a policeman walks by ‘n’ sees it so Chaplin picks up the baby again ‘n’ then he walks to a different street trying to to find someone to get the baby to then he sees a man who walks on a cane and he gives the baby to him and kind of acting like he's just tying his shoelaces and then he runs away and hides and uh then the man with the cane who has the baby uh puts the baby into a stroller again which happens to be the same stroller of the same woman as before and then he walks away while the woman wasn't there at the second ‘n’ then Chaplin walks by while the woman gets out ‘n’ sees the baby in there again ‘n’ then he hhh he sh= she chases after Chaplin ‘n’ kind of beats him down and and tells him to to get the baby out again which he uh kind of doesn't ‘n’ then the policeman walks by again and she tells the policeman about this isn't this isn't that this isn’t her baby and then he takes it out again ‘n’ ‘n’ ‘n’ leaves the the scene uh hhh what happens next uh I think / if I remember correctly he / sits down with the baby ‘n’ then he finds a letter uh while he he kind of looks at the baby ‘n’ the letter says that this is an orphan child ‘n’ that the letter uh whoever wrote it hopes that someone will care ‘n’ love for the love the child ‘n’ then it looks like he kind of uh / thinks about what to do with it ‘n’ then kind of starts liking it ‘n’ he walks up with the baby ‘n’ then the video ends
okay so the scene starts with Mr. Chaplin walking down the street and he walks past uh what seems to be a construction site and while he's walking he's smoking a cigarette and uh swinging his cane uh / walking his way somehow uh some sort of rubble seems to fall onto him uh of which he's uh annoyed and uh apparently his cigarette fell out uh on the ground so he takes out his box where he has uh several cigarettes which seem to be uh cigarettes he also found on the ground so uh like rests of cigarettes and he lights the new one hhh and keeps on going his way but sees a baby lying on the ground next to him uh covered or uh hhh in in a blanket hhh and uh he picks the baby up and looks around and tries to figure out uh whose baby it is and uh he sees uh a woman walking by with a uh stroller and uh goes to her and puts the baby in the stroller ‘cos he thinks uh it's her baby but she's uh she gets angry because it isn't and uh basically prompts him to take the baby back uh which he does uh he then tries to figure out what to do next and he wants to put the baby where he found it on the ground but uh as he's doing or as he wants to do that uh a policeman shows up and stops him from doing that hhh uh of which he again is uh a bit annoyed because he doesn't kn= uh know what to do with the baby so he keeps on going his way and uh sees another man walking past who also has a cane and uh he wants to trick him by uh giving him the baby to hold it so he can u hhh tie his shoes but he just uh / uh he acts like if he was going to tie his shoes but then he just starts to go away and hopes that uh the man will keep the baby and that the problem is now done for him uh the other man now uh who has the baby goes uh around and looking where to or wha= what to do with the baby and he then finds the tr= the the stroller uh standing around uh un= uh unwatched by the woman so he just puts it in the stroller and uh uh is back on his way uh Mr. Chaplin now is uh hhh a bit happier and walks uh around the streets again uh while and passes the stroller uh during which time the woman uh whose stroller is uh sees that there's the other baby again and is confused and looks around and sees Mr. Chaplin and uh hhh thinks that he put the baby in her stroller uh and he runs up to him and hits him with a with her umbrella and uh they both go to the stroller and the policeman comes and prompts uh Mr. Chaplin in the end to take the baby back uh which he does and then he again doesn't know what to do and sits on the sidewalk and thinks about uh throwing the baby in the sewers but uh then doesn't and he has a look at the baby and the blanket and finds the letter and uh or piece of paper and on it it says uh please care ‘n’ love for this orphan child I think and uh he's move= or he seems to be moved by the words and looks at the baby and uh as it seems he is uh happier and uh he accepts the baby in a sense and takes it with him and goes back on his way
well the uh black ‘n’ white short film uh the kid or the baby uh is about a man Charles Chaplin and uh well it's about uh how he uh finds a baby in the streets and uh it is lying on the floor next to a big building and uh yeah he's just walking hhh around there and suddenly he uh yeah he sees it and uh yeah he he looks at it and uh yeah starts to wonder where it belongs and uh picks it up and yeah and tries to find out where it belongs and uh then a w= woman or a mother uh / comes into uh the picture and uh hhh carrying a uh baby carriage and uh with another baby in it and uh Charlie Chaplin thinks that uh maybe the child belongs or the baby belongs to that mother and uh then he uh hhh he tries to put that baby into the carriage and uh yeah tries to uh get away as uh quick as possible hhh and uh the mother whe= when the mother uh sees the baby she gets angry and uh hhh follows Charlie Chaplin and hits him and yeah gives the baby back to him and during the movie there are several different attempts from Charlie Chaplin to get rid of the baby and uh also police officer’s involved and sometimes it's uh very funny hhh how he tries to get rid of it and uh hhh in the end after yeah a few failed attempts to get rid of the baby he uh sits down with the baby uh and uh yeah and looks at it and starts to feel sorry for the baby and uh he uh hhh discovers a uh tiny uh note from the mother of the baby that says that she's sorry and uh whoever finds the baby or the orphan baby uh that he or she should care for it yeah and then he feels even more sorry and yeah and the movie is over
okay my my my task is just to uh tell you what is going on in the short film okay uh in the short film that I just watched uh Charlie Chaplin is uh strolling down a street and uh it looks very dirty there people are throwing garbage out of the window uh hhh and uh when he's hit by some garbage that was thrown out of the window he swears I think he says awkward ass to the person that threw the garbage out of the window uh he stops tries to light a cigarette but then recognizes that in a corner near him uh next to some some garbage bins uh a baby wrapped around in some blankets uh uh a baby is lying wrapped around in some and uh then he he picks up the baby hhh and uh discovers that behind him a woman with a I think it's called a buggy in in English uh like this this baby stroller thing uh is walking behind him hhh and uh stops with this buggy and uh walks into a house he then tries to put the baby into said buggy uh and hopes she doesn't uh yeah she she doesn't see him or something uh but the problem for him is that she sees him doing so and uh makes him take the baby again and  uh then he walks / walks back to the corner where with with the baby wh= where he found the baby and uh puts it back where he found it but uh then he turns around and sees that a policeman saw him put the baby back into the corner uh so he picks up the baby again and walks around some some corner he's he's in in a different street in the next scene where an old man walks with his cane and uh he then uh yeah well he he doesn't talk but he uh shows the the old man his shoe uh in order to show that he has to tie his shoe laces uh hhh and makes makes the old man take the baby that way so the old man takes the baby from him and uh yeah holds it in his arms while Charlie Chaplin is running away and uh he's hiding near the corner that whe= where he found the baby again uh the old man hhh tries to well tries to run after Charlie Chaplin but is not as as fast as him and uh puts the baby into the stroller that uh from the from one of the first scenes hhh uh from the woman that that uh walked there with with her baby uh the at that time the woman is in the house then uh in the next scene Charlie Chaplin uh strolls along uh a street where this where this stroller stands hhh and hhh uh at at that certain moment uh the woman comes back out of the house so uh she yeah well she sees the baby she sees Charlie Chaplin and uh she thinks that Chaplin put the baby into her stroller again she then uh yeah runs after him and hits him very hard with her umbrella uh hhh and makes him take the baby again so uh he picks up the baby again hhh uh and uh walks I don't know few me= meters further and sits down at the pavement hhh uh hhh then well he holds his baby in his arms and then he recognizes that there's a letter hidden inside the blankets hhh uh on on the letter it says in the letter it says uh please love ‘n’ care for this orphan child I think uh so then uh Chaplin yeah gets to know that the child is an orphan hhh and uh in the last well that that's the last scene and he he looks at it with love in his eyes I think and uh looks very happy smiles at it and in the end he stands up and uh walks away with the baby in his arms
uh alright uh Charlie Sheen walks down an alleyway and he gets almost hit by uh bricks from an nearby construction site and then uh the trash almost uh then he gets hit by trash and someone who throws it out of the window then he finds a baby near a dumpster or trash can and he don’t know what to do with it so uh he sees a woman with a baby carrier and uh puts the baby inside it the woman is uh furious and he hits him with xxx and then yes he take the baby back and he desperately tries to uh get rid of the baby then he sees a near= nearby stranger walking with a with a cane and he uh just gives it gives it to him and he don’t know what to do with it uh either so uh he puts it in in the same baby carrier as well uh then later on uh Charlie Chaplin walks by the baby carrier again accidentally uh accidentally and uh the the woman hits him with uh an umbrella then then he has to take uh the baby back again ‘n’ then at the end of the movie he uh is thinking about leaving that baby in the in the sewer xxx manhole and he doesn’t do it of course uh and then there he uh sees a note and the baby I think somewhere in on the jumpsuit a note that uh someone should care about the uh the baby yeah hhh
so in this short Charles Chaplin clip we can see Charles Chaplin uh not having the luckiest of days when he walks walks through a rather gloomy looking area in the city and avoids someone throwing their trash hhh out of their window uh barely and soon after finds a baby uh laying near a trashcan in uh this area he proceeds to to pick up the baby and try to find his owner but uh hhh finds out that the woman that carries uh looks like she she could be the mother of the child does not really uh / does not really want to take care of the child that doesn’t belong to her and he he has to uh find another way to get rid of the child he proceeds to to uh try try multiple attempts to get rid of the child gives it to random strangers and uh runs away tries to hide from them but uh without any suc= success and at the end he finds himself sitting on the on the on the edge of the street uh looking closer at the child taking closer look and he finds a letter uh inside the wrappings of the baby and uh it appears to to to get to him that uh the mother or or the parent is just asking to take care of the child and he he smiles at the baby and uh stands up picks up the child and uh it appears he appears to be ready to take care of the child
ok uh a man walked down the street and found a baby next to a trash can uh he takes the baby and uh s= he he took the baby and he saw a a woman with a buggy and he thought that the baby belongs to this woman so he put the baby into the buggy but the wo= the woman makes made him clear that uh it is not he= her child so he takes the bab= he took the baby again and uh he wanned to put it back where he found it and in this moment a police officer uh saw wha= uh saw that he drops the baby next to the trash can again so uh to avoid any misunderstanding he uh took the baby again and tricks an old man into  / uh into taking the baby uh / he plays uh he played hide and seek with him hhh and uh the old man the older man who now is the little baby and puts the baby into the buggy of the woman again but uh / and a w= but after he did that uh / the man who originally found the baby walks by walks by the woman with the buggy and the woman thinks that he dropped it he he put it again into uh the buggy so she follows him and / yeah beats him up hhh with a I don’t remember exactly what it was uh she beats him up with some kind of stick and uh / walks with him to the police officer and / yeah the the man who originally found the baby uh takes the baby again and uh / and uh sits down and he thought about throwing the baby into the canalization but uh he didn’t do it and then he found a letter uh / in some kind of pocket uh of the clothes of the baby and on this letter it said that uh it says something like please take care and love this orphan child and then he decided to keep the baby the baby he will love ‘n’ care about it but we don’t know because it wasn’t in the video
the video starts with Charlie Chaplin walking down an alley and he almost gets hits gets hit by things that are thrown out of windows from the houses and he becomes angry uh he comes to a stand and lights himself a cigarette and stands there smoking as he sees a child lying on the floor and uh he looks at the child uh looks around if there’s anyone whom the child could belong uh but he doesn’t find anyone so he picks the child up and a woman walks by with a baby carriage where there is a child sitting in it and so Chaplin puts the baby he found into this same baby carriage and tells the woman that she must have dropped something but the woman becomes angry and so Chaplin takes the baby again with him and wants to put it on the same place on the ground where he found the baby uh but suddenly a police office= officer uh approaches and so Chaplin again takes the baby with him uh walking down the streets again he sees an old man and he just uh gives the old man the baby and runs away quickly the old man takes the baby with him and sees the baby carriage which exactly is the same baby carriage in which Chaplin put the baby so the old man puts the baby in it uh because it is standing yeah without anyone seeing it or looking for it in front of a shop so the old man puts the baby in it and when the woman comes out of the shop she sees that the child is in her baby carriage again ‘n’ in at that moment Chaplin walks by so the woman thinks Chaplin put the baby in it and hits him with her umbrella ‘n’ gets angry and the police officer comes again so Chaplin takes the baby with him and sits down on the sidewalk thinking about what he wants to do now and he looks at the canalization uh besides him ‘n’ thinks about putting the baby in it but he decides not to do so and then he finds a note in the blankets of the baby saying please care ‘n’ love this orphan child and so uh Chaplin walks away cradling the little baby
the protagonist of the video is Charles Chaplin that uh I can read in the title and in the first sequence he walks along the streets and uh he almost gets hit by an object that has been thrown out of the window uh he looks up but he can’t find the person who did it uh afterwards he finds a little bundle a baby in the corner of the street uh he picks it up uh and he tries to find the person who left the baby there uh he looks up uh thinking about somebody could threw it out of the window as well uh he can’t find anybody uh and then he picks it up and walks uh to another corner of the street uh and he finds a woman with a little baby buggy and uh he uh puts the baby there when the woman doesn’t look uh and uh then the woman comes back and hhh and uh asks him or uh yeah tries to make him explain wha= wha= why he did it uh and then they get into a fight and uh she uh basically forces him to take back the baby because it= it’s not hers uh and uh yes so he is forced to take the baby and uh continues walking on uh and then he finds an old man with a walking stick and with a little trick he uh gets the man to take the baby uh and then Charles Chaplin runs away very quickly and uh the man uh being not being able to run as fast as uh Chaplin uh has to take the baby and uh he can’t find Chaplin because he ran away uh and then the older man he uh puts the baby in the buggy uh of the woman that uh Chaplin had a fight with before and uh yeah the woman uh thinking it was Chaplin again uh finds Charl= Charlie Chaplin when he’s walking passed the buggy but he doesn’t know that the baby is on the buggy because he didn’t do it this time and uh yeah but the woman think= thinks that he did it again uh and uh beats him with a with her umbrella and uh yeah then uh they have a little fighting scene and uh then the policeman uh comes and and uh yeah gets uh Chaplin to take the baby again uh who does what he is being said and uh then uh he is he sits down with the baby in his arms uh he thinks for instance to about throwing the baby in the sewer but he doesn’t do it uh and then he finds a little letter that uh was in the in the blanket of that the baby had wrapped around so and uh in the letter it says uh take please take care of this orphan child and uh Chaplin reads it and then uh stands up uh with the baby ‘n’ walks uh walks away ‘n’ that’s how uh the clip ended
so the video starts off with Charlie Chaplin walking down an alleyway uh he’s nearly hit by trash which is falling out of a window and then proceeds on his way however he is shortly after hit by trash or what looks like trash from another window uh after that he lights up a cigarette uh and after he’s done with that he discovers a baby lying next to a trashcan on the ground uh he spots an a woman with a trolley stroller uh walking behind him so he picks up the baby and proceeds to lay it down inside the stroller thinking that it’s hers and uh he’s also telling her uh her that she dropped something uh after a little arguing uh because it is not really her child he picks it up again uh walks back to the location he found it at and uh proceeds to drop it off then a police officer walks up behind him and saw that he dropped the baby so / he obviously doesn’t know that it’s not Charlie Chaplin’s baby and Charlie Chaplin doesn’t want to uh be arrested so he picks the baby up again uh he walks down the alley= alleyway further and sees a man who’s not really good on foot uh it looks like he is disabled in some way uh he tries to trick him by saying that he need= needs to tie his shoe laces and hands the baby over to the man uh and after that he runs off and hides in the place he first found the baby uh after / exiting his uh his place where he uh was hiding at uh the police officer again meets him and he proceeds to quickly walk away uh meanwhile the disabled man uh also walks by the woman with the stroller and proceeds to drop the baby into the stroller and just walks away uh while walking away from the police officer Chaplin walks next to the stroller where the baby is in and uh the woman immediately recognises him and starts to beat him with her umbrella I think uh then he picks the baby up again after she also call= called the police officer to the side uh yeah then he obviously has to take the baby uh if he doesn’t want to face uh any penalties and proceeds to walk down the street and sit down on the sidewalk uh he then thinks to himself what he should do with the baby uh also opening the sewers and uh debating to himself sh= if he should drop the baby into the sewer but proceeds not to do that uh he then finds a letter uh which is which was hided inside some towels the baby was in uh which says that the child is uh an orphan uh and so he decides to / keep the child at first and uh walks down with a smile walks away with a smile walks down the alleyway with a smile
uh in the video there’s Charlie Chaplin uh walking around in a pretty run-down town which looks kind of like uh post-war but it’s not really uh really specified uh he runs around he stops and to light a cigarette and while he does that he uh finds a baby lying on the ground uh he picks it up and looks around to find if he can see anyone whom this baby might belong to uh he doesn’t find anyone but there’s a woman walking by with a uh baby and uh while she goes into a shop or something he walks over to put uh the found baby next to the baby of the mother uh but while he do he does it uh she comes out of the shop or of the building again and uh they have a conversation kind of not really because it’s a silent movie but in implied conversation uh she kind of uh tells him or makes him see that he can’t uh just put his ba= the baby there and that he has to take it away again so he does that uh goes back to uh the place where he found the baby uh and decides to just put it down but after he did it he turns around to uh to find a policeman and uh probably just picks up the baby again to not to get in trouble walks around a bit with the baby to see where he can dispose of it kind of and uh finds an old man he decides to trick so he just like uh gives the baby to the old man uh and / kind of just uh / ties his shoe or pretends to tie his shoe but uh runs away the old man is stuck with the baby then and walks around with it a bit finds the mother again with the child uh who is again in the shop ‘n’ is not there to look over the child child and just uh the old man then just uh lies one child next to the other again just like Charlie Chaplin did before and uh walks away the uh the mother comes out of the uh shop again sees the two babies in the cart and uh right in that moment Charlen Charlie Chaplin walks by which kind of makes the mother think that Charlie just put the baby into the cart again he uh she walks hunts him down kind of with a umbrella uh and makes him makes him take the child again he then uh walks around a bit sees that he can’t really get rid of the child uh sits down with it uh at the side of the street and just like looks a a at it a bit and everything and finds a little letter uh that’s stuck in the bundle of clothes that the uh baby uh is in and uh the letter says that please love ‘n’ care for this orphan child or something like that and at the end he just walks away with the child ‘n’ it’s kind of okay he cares for it
okay so this was a video of uh about Charlie Chaplin / it begins with the scene where Charlie uh walks through a neighborhood which seems a little rough / hhh and then suddenly there’s things dropped on top of an= of from above and they fall on him or close to him / and he’s wondering where it comes from ‘n’ he’s really annoyed by it it seems to be like that and uh / he then lights some uh cigarettes / and when walking around the corner I think uh he / discovers that there’s a child lying in the corner and he doesn’t seem to find a mother to it or anything so then he walks uh / around the corner walks a little bit and sees uh / an / a mother with a / hhh pushchair or something like that and uh he puts the baby in it / and kind of expects that it belongs to this mother because there’s another baby in it ‘n’ there’s room for a second one / so uh the mother obviously says it’s not my baby ‘n’ you can’t just drop it her= or she doesn’t say it but it looks like she says it / and / she then / uh so he then has to pick it up again and he decides that he just drops it back where he founds it / f= found it uh / but when he does that he / uh is uh / watched by a policeman / and because he doesn’t want any trouble or whatever hhh he picks it back up again / and just kind of walks away / and / then uh stumbling across an old man / and he acts like he has something stuck on his shoe / and therefore gives the baby to the old man / and / pretends like he’s cleaning his shoe but then running away really quickly ‘n’ the old man doesn’t / can’t follow / and / so when the old man doesn= know what to do with the baby he sees an / unsupervised pushchair / again with one baby the same pushchair that was there before / and put the baby in it / ‘n’ walks away / and doesn’t get caught by the mother / ‘n’ when the mother comes out and sees the second baby in it / exactly in that moment Charlie Chaplin walks by again / so she follows him ‘n’ kind of hits him with his with her umbrella / and / yeah / basically looks like she shouts at him to take this baby back ‘n’ that’s not hers / he then makes uh kind of the move to pick up the wrong baby / so the baby that’s actually the mother’s baby / and but in the end she he does pick up the baby that’s / uh the one that he’d apparently dropped / but I th= it seems like only because the policeman is standing next to them again / and yeah he then walks off / drops his / I guess you can call it the cane / uh no it’s not a cane because it’s not for a blind person but his walking stick whatever / and he then uh he drops it so he had to sit on the curve uh / curb / and / when / sitting there he has uh / kind of a drain next to him ‘n’ he looks into it / ‘n’ it looks like he uh / thinks about dropping the baby in there / but then he decides against it ‘n’ looks a little into the blankets that’s round and / uh kind of devel= / envelop the baby / and he finds a letter that says please / love and I think care for this orphan child / and he then / it seems like he has uh / kind of / doesn’t seem like he develops straightaway loving feelings but he seems to care about it more seeing as it is an orphan child and / he walks off with it ‘n’ it’s unknown to the viewer if it’s / if he put brings it to an orphanage or if he keeps it or anything but it’s / seems like an happy end
ok so the protagonist walks down an alley street and he’s hit by dust or trash that’s thrown out of the window ug he lights his cigarette ‘n’ then next to some trash bins he finds a child uh small baby wrapped in blankets and uh he picks it up and sees a woman passing by with a stroller with her own child in it and he follows the woman and puts the ch= the the child he picked up into the stroller ‘n’ uh then the woman scolds him and refuses to take the baby so uh the protagonist picks it up again and wants to put it back where he found it next to the trash bins but there’s a police officer right behind him so uh Chaplin is uh forced to take the child again uh he walks in another street and tricks another walking man uh into taking the child / uh and this man sees the stroller again parked outside of a shop the woman must have left it there uh and puts it back into the uh carriage uh but uh the moment the woman comes out of the shop Chaplin passes by so she thinks that he put it back there and follows him and beats him with her umbrella hhh ‘n’ then also the police officer appears so Chaplin was again forced to take the child so he sits down with it at the road side and finds a piece of paper attached to the infant that says uh please take care of this orphan child or something like that and uh yeah Chaplin smiles at the child ‘n’ then picks it up xxx
in the video you see a man uh walking down the street and some debris is falling onto his head some stones from windows of the houses surrounding him and he stops to light a cigarette ‘n’ when he’s standing there smoking he notices a child that has been left at the corner of a house and he picks it up uh he then continues walking with the child and places it in a trolley of a woman that has already a child in it and / and then he leaves uh no he doesn’t leave the woman the no the woman notices that he tries to put a child in her trolley and hands the child back to her very angrily back to him very angrily and he then takes the child and tries to put it down uh at the place where he found it originally and but he notices that a police officer saw him try uh leaving the child and abandoning it so he picks it up again and gives it to a man who is also walking down the street uh this man then tries to put it back in the trolley of the woman and hhh uh as as he does so he doesn’t get noticed by the woman who’s currently in a shop and he leaves and then a few minutes later the man passes the woman again uh so the original man passes the woman again and he passes the trolley just as the woman leaves the store and she notices him and automatically assumed that he was the one that again tried to put a child into her trolley and beats him up with her umbrella and then he takes the child uh again and sits down uh at the uh at the corner of the street and uh takes a closer look at the child and then he notices that there’s a piece of paper uh within the child’s clothes that reads please love and care for this orphan child
uh in the video you can see a man who’s walking down the street and there’s stuff thrown from above he’s almost hit by it but then goes on uh a few meters uh along the road he gets hit by stuff from uh above uh he then looks up trying to find out where it came from uh then decides to lit a cigarette with his shoe and uh when he looks to his left he sees a lonely child sitting on the road a baby he picks up the baby and tries tries to find out where it came from and so he’s looking up but can’t find where it came from he then sees a woman with a stroller and a baby inside and assumes that the baby might be hers he goes to her and put the child inside the stroller but she argues with him that it’s not her child and he has to take out the child again he then uh decides to put it the child where it came from but there’s a policeman behind him so he takes the baby up again next he sees an old man and give the child to gives the child to him while he’s acting like he has to tie his shoe laces uh then he quickly runs away the old man tries to follow him but does not see him so the old man finds the woman again with the stroller and also assumes that it might be her child so he puts the child into the stroller the ‘n’ then runs away the woman comes back to the stroller and sees the first man uh walking by her so he she assumes that it was him who put the child there again and starts running after him and hitting him with her umbrella uh they argue again until the policeman comes to them so the man decides to take the child away again he sits down on the street with the child opens the entrance to a sewer but decides not to put the child there then he take the child into his arms and searches it ‘n’ then he finds a letter saying please love and care for this orphan child so he has a closer look at the child decides to keep it and then they uh walk away together
uh so the video starts with uh a well-dressed man walking through a lane and then he stops to light a cigarette and uh he hears ‘n’ sees a baby next to lying on the ground next to uh some trash cans and uh he picks up the baby and looks around uh to look whether there is a person who the baby belongs to uh but first he doesn’t see anyone and then uh the woman walks by with a baby carrier with a baby in it and he thinks maybe the baby belongs to her and uh so when she’s not looking he puts the baby in her baby carrier uh but then she notices and uh is angry at him uh angry with him and uh gets the baby back to him uh and so he doesn’t know what to do with the baby and uh puts it back to the uh back back next to the trash cans on the ground but a police officer notices and uh tells him to pick the baby up again because he thinks or probably thinks that the man just tried to get rid of the baby his baby uh / and so the man put takes takes it back and uh / goes on and uh he walks by uh another man uh and tries to trick him into taking the baby and runs away uh hhh then the second man uh hhh doesn’t want the baby either and puts it into a baby carrier near him and that uh actually is the same carrier of that same woman woman uh hhh and she notices it again but uh the man who put the baby in the carrier is already gone uh but now the first man walks by so the woman thinks it’s his fault uh and gives the baby back again hhh and then uh the m= he walks or he sits down with the baby on a on the sidewalk and thinks how to get rid of it uh and then he looks at the baby and notices uh a note where it says uh please love ‘n’ care for this orphan child uh and he reads that and looks at the b= the child with a or he smiles at the child and uh takes him ‘n’ walks off
ok so in the video there’s a man I suppose it’s Charlie Chaplin and he walks down the street smoking a cigarette or a cigar I’m not sure and as he walks down that street he gets hit by something that’s falling out of the window or something stomping it from above which is like extin= extinguishing the cigarette then he gets out like a little metal box from his pocket and  picks another cigarette lights that one as he looks around he sees a little baby wrapped in a blanket laying on the floor next to a trash can and he picks up that baby looks around trying to figure out where it’s come from or if he could find someone that’s like the mom or the dad and in the background there’s a lady pushing a pram with another child in it so he calls out for her as he thinks maybe the baby belongs to her and as she doesn’t react he follows her and she enters into a building he just puts the baby in the pram she comes back out ‘n’ sees it ‘n’ then complains that’s not her child ‘n’ the two of them argue a bit she gets quite angry ‘n’ he gets the baby back out of the pram walks back to where he found it and then he just puts the baby next to the trash can ‘n’ wants to walks away but then there is a police officer of some sort behind him so he just picks the baby straight back up ‘n’ walks away with it then he kinda enters to another street and steps into like a puddle of mud or something like that ‘n’ there’s another man and he asks that man to hold the baby so he can clean up his shoes or his pants and as he gives the baby over to the other man he kinda pretends to clean his pants he just runs away and as the other man realizes that he follows him but he isn’t that fast because he’s got a walking stick and Charlie Chaplin then finds a a garage I think and the other man just kinda looks around for him and then sees the pram of that lady that Charlie went to ‘n’ puts the baby in ‘n’ walks away and then Charlie exits the garage ‘n’ wants to walk in the other direction but then there’s the police officer again so has to turn around walk the other way again ‘n’ then there’s as the lady that the pram belongs to that we’ve already seen before comes out of the building and realizes that the child is in her pram again he passes her and she like gets real angry he runs away she follows him hits with her umbrella and kinda drags him back to the pram which is also when the police officer comes by again and she complains that he again dropped the child into her pram snd that he should take it which he then does and walks away he kinda like takes that baby ‘n’ sits down side of the street with it and I don’t know he opens like a drainage cover it or something like that I don’t know contemplating to put the baby in there I’m not sure but then as he looks through the blankets that the baby is wrapped in he finds a letter that says please love ‘n’ care for this orphan child I think and after reading that he just picks up the baby again ‘n’ walks away I think
ok so Charlie Chaplin was walking through the back valley alleys and uh he lights a cigarette or a cigar I don’t know and uh he sees a baby lying in on the ground next to uh some garbage cans he takes the baby ’n’ he’s kind of confused and then he sees a woman with like a big baby carriage walking in the back so he thinks it must be her baby ‘n’ puts it in the carriage then sh= the woman comes back outside from a house or like a supermarket and hhh she uh sees the baby and tells him that it’s not hers to uh she gives it back to Charlie Chaplin and he’s confused and walks back then decides to put it back on the ground where he find where he has found it and then uh there’s a policeman who comes back to him ‘n’ sees what he’s doing so he has to take the baby back and he’s kind of annoyed about it so uh he takes the baby ‘n’ walks away but puts it into the hands of an old man and runs away the old man uh also decides to put it back into the baby carriage uh when the woman isn’t looking so uh when Charlie Chaplin is walking pass the baby carriage again the woman sees that the baby is back in the baby carriage and tr= and is hitting him and uh then he takes the baby back because the policeman came back too so he walks around with the baby sits on the ground shortly thinking about putting it into the I don’t know the English word for it uh and then he uh sees that there’s a little letter attached to uh the baby and he reads it and it says I think please love ‘n’ care for this orphan child so he looks at the baby and kind of starts to like care for it and uh decides to keep it which is not sure and then he walks away
ok so in this videoclip uh Charlie Chaplin is walking down an alley uh when he gets hit by thrash that somebody seems to be throwing down from a window and this thrash seems to extinguish his cigarette so he needs to light a new cigarette and he gets a a new cigarette out of his pocket and then uh he discovers a baby laying on the floor bundled up in blankets and uh hhh he goes to see where it comes from ‘n’ he picks it up and is wondering where the baby came from ‘n’ then he sees uh a woman walking by with a baby carriage so it seems like he assumes that the baby must’ve come from her so he quickly runs up to her and puts the baby into the baby carriage uh and there’s already another baby inside of the baby carriage and uh then the woman uh comes back or sees that and she obviously seems to be uh angry about it or she it obviously isn’t her baby so she gives the baby back to Charlie hhh and she leaves and then uh Charlie doesn’t seem to know what else to do so he goes back to where he found the baby ‘n’ puts it back on the ground but then a police officer comes walking by and uh hhh so he is kind of so Charlie is kind of forced to pick the baby back up ‘n’ goes somewhere else and then uh he takes the baby ‘n’ walks around the corner where he sees an old man walking uh hhh so it seems like he asks the old man to hold the baby for a second when he tries to or pretends to tie his shoe uh hhh and then when the old man holds the baby Charlie quickly runs away ‘n’ hides in a garage uh hhh and so then the old man doesn’t really know what to do with baby so he walks around the corner and I think he sees the baby carriage or he sees a baby carriage in front of a store hhh and uh so he walks up to this baby carriage ‘n’ puts the baby inside of this baby carriage again uh and then the lady from before comes out of the store ‘n’ sees the baby but doesn’t know where it came from and meanwhile uh hhh Charlie came out of his uh hideout and sees the police officer again so he walks around the corner and is walking down the street where the old man had put the baby inside the baby carriage of the lady from before uh so the lady sees Charlie and thinks once again that he has put the baby into the baby carriage so she runs after him and drags him back ‘n’ starts to beat him with her umbrella and they start fighting or getting into an argument or discussing again uh hhh and so once again the police officer comes walking by and so when the lady uh starts to explain the situation to the police officer uh Charlie finally takes the baby ‘n’ walks away and again it seems like he doesn’t know what to do so he sits down on uh on the sidewalk and seems to uh think about what to do and  then there is a a sewer next to him and he opens the sewer and it seems like he is considering to put the baby into the sewer but then he closes it and takes another closer look at the baby and uh hhh then he seems to hurt his finger somewhere in the blankets of the baby and he finds a message between the blankets uh and the message is a piece of a paper and it says uh please take care please love ‘n’ care for this orphan child or something like that and so uh hhh that seems to change his mind and he takes a closer look at the baby and then finally starts smiling at it and t= talking to it and it seems like uh he has finally decided to uh yeah to be ok with it ‘n’ to take care of the baby so uh he takes it he stands up with the baby and walks away with it together
ok so Charlie walks down the street and uh smoking his cigar and he drops it because he is being hit by what looks like garbage being thrown out of a window and while he tries to light the cigar up again he finds a baby lying right next to the garbage bins he picks it up and right at that moment a woman with a pram ‘n’ a small child inside is passing and he thinks the child belongs to her so he puts it in the pram while she is looking away she of course is not the mother and she forces him to take the baby with him again so he decides to put it back where he found it uh but is caught by a p= by a police officer who of course demands that he takes the baby again uh he goes into the next street and there’s a man with a walking stick and he  tricks him into holding the baby by pretending to tie his shoes and then running off uh now the man is stuck with the baby and he finds the same pram from before and while the woman is inside the shop he puts the baby into the pram and then walks up and as the woman uh exits the shop again she sees Charlie ‘n’ of course the false baby inside the pram ‘n’ of course thinks that he puts it in the pram again ‘n’ starts beating him up with her umbrella uh ‘n’ then after an argument also involving a police officer Charlie is again stuck with the baby so he walks off ‘n’ after a while he drops his cane ‘n’ has to sit down to pick it up ‘n’ then after considering  throwing the baby into the gutter for a few seconds he starts to examine it ‘n’ finds a small piece of paper inside the blanket which says uh something about the child being an orphan and that he should love ‘n’ care for it ‘n’ so he has a change of heart ‘n’ then decides to leave with the baby and not putting it away
uh Charlie Chaplin walks into an alleyway uh and he gets hit by some debris and and he lights a cigarette or cigar and as he glances down he sees a baby which has probably been abandoned and he looks around uh whether there’s someone around maybe and he takes the baby then uh sees there’s a mother walking by with a pram and as the mother leaves behind the pram to go somewhere he puts the baby in the pram next to another baby ‘n’ the mother comes back and she is enraged and angry and tells him to take back the baby probably and he does finally and as he goes to put the baby back in the alley there’s a policeman and so he can’t put the baby back where he found it and he walks around the corner and there’s an old man with a cane and he hands the baby to the man and runs away ‘n’ hides and then the old man uh walks away and sees that same pram standing in front of a store and puts the baby inside as well and then Charlie Chaplin comes out of his hiding place ‘n’ sees the policeman and hastily walks away and the policeman follows him and Charlie Chaplin walks pass that same pram again and uh just as the mother comes outside and sees Charlie Chaplin and the second baby in the pram and yells at him probably to take the baby out again and as the policeman arrives he does and walks uh to sit on the sidewalk and he opens a hatch and probably thinks about like putting the baby inside and then he finds a note on the baby which says love ‘n’ care for this orphan child or something like that and he gets up and walks away with the baby
uh so in the beginning you can see a man walking along an alley way uh dogging uh I don’t know something like that looks like a bricks being thrown out of a window uh and uh he finally gets hit with something and after that he decides to light a cigar and uh after that he finds a baby lying behind some trash cans uh he picks it up and uh looks around ‘n’ sees a woman uh with a pram and uh decides that it must be her baby ‘n’ puts it into her pram and she gets angry ‘n’ tells him no it’s not my baby uh and he then uh decides to just put the baby back to where he found it uh but runs into a police officer and uh then picks it back up and uh / walks around with it and uh find and comes across an old man and  tricks him into holding the baby ‘n’ then runs away uh the old man follows him but can’t find him and then the old man sees the pram outside of a shop and just puts the baby in that pram and the man from before uh comes out of his hiding place and uh walks by the pram ‘n’ the woman uh notices him ‘n’ sees that the baby is back in her pram and uh she runs after him ‘n’ beats him with her umbrella and uh basically uh wants him to take the baby back uh and he only does so when the police officer from before uh comes back and uh then he picks the baby back up and walks away and uh sits down somewhere on the pavement ‘n’ finds a letter uh that tells him that this is an orphan baby and to please love ‘n’ care for it and uh then he just holds it and that’s it
the video starts with Charlie Chaplin walking down the street and then uh he discovers like a baby on the side and he is unsure what to do with it so he picks it up and then round the corner he sees a woman with a pram something so he decides to put it in there ‘n’ walk away but then the woman sees it and it’s not her child I think so she tries she argues with him ‘n’ forces him to take it back so he sat with the baby again ‘n’ he really doesn’t know what to do with it so he wants to put it back where he actually found it in the first place but there’s a police officer or some official person and he actually makes him take the baby again so he needs to find like another solution ‘n’ then walks across the street and he sees another stranger passing by so that’s why he gives the baby to him ‘n’ then runs away so now uh this stranger is in the same position now as he initially was and that’s why the stranger also tries to find a place where he can put the baby ‘n’ then he sees the same woman with the same pram ‘n’ also puts the baby in there ‘n’ the woman I think she was like in shock or something but then she walks out ‘n’ then sees the baby again ‘n’ is really angry but the stranger already disappeared ‘n’ Ch= uh Charles like accidentally walks by ‘n’ so she assumes it was him again so she argues with him again I think she beats him with like a umbrella or something and yeah then this police officer also joins them ‘n’ they argue ‘n’ in the end Charles is left with the baby and yeah he sits like down on a pavement ‘n’ considers what to do with it now ‘n’ then he finds like a little note that I don’t actually quite remember but I think it says something like please love ‘n’ care for this orphan child ‘n’ yeah so he I think he decides to do that ‘n’ walks away with the baby
ok so it starts when Charles Chaplin walks through a town and he gets hit by someone probably throwing thrash out of the window uh when he stops to light a cigarette and when he tries to continue walking he sees a baby lying on the ground in the corner so he looks up to see maybe where it came from or if he’s if the baby is gonna get hit by something as well and he picks up the baby and continues walking with it but he doesn’t seem to want it so he looks for somewhere to drop it and that’s when he sees a mother carrying like a pram uh with another child in it so when the mother doesn’t look he tries to put the baby he found into the pram but the mother obviously realises that it’s not her child so she uh makes him get it out again and he walks back to where he found the baby ‘n’ puts it back on the floor but then when he wants to walk away he runs into a probably a police officer and he makes him pick up the baby again so he picks it up again ‘n’ walks away again and that’s when he sees another man walking so he pretends that he needs to tie his shoes so he hands the other man the baby and runs away quickly ‘n’ the other man tries to follow him but Charles Chaplin hides somewhere so he the man doesn’t find him so then the man sees the same pram that Charles already put the baby in ‘n’ is still standing outside somewhere he puts it in there again and walks away so Charles thinks that he’s safe now ‘n’ gets out of his hiding place and walks past the same pram so the mother sees him again ‘n’ thinks that he tried to put the baby in it again so she starts hitting him with her um= umbrella and tells the police man what happened so Charles Chaplin has to get back the baby again and he walks back to where he came from ‘n’ already thinks about putting it into the gutter basically and that is when he sits down ‘n’ he doesn’t seem to know what he is doin so he looks at the baby ‘n’ then finds this little note that says please take care and love this orphan child and then he suddenly starts smiling ‘n’ taking care of the baby ‘n’ just walks away with it ‘n’ seems to keep it
ok at the start of the scene or the video there’s a man or protagonist walking down an alleyway and uh he’s smoking and dodges some stuff that is thrown out of a window and uh later he is hit by some trash uh that was also thrown out of a window and uh he relights his cigarette or takes out another one and when he turns around he finds that there’s a baby lying on the ground so he picks the baby up and uh looks around for the source of the baby and uh behind him you can see a woman with a pram walking and he seems to assume that the woman dropped the baby and walks over to the pram ‘n’ puts the baby into the pram the woman is not happy about that and tells him to take the baby back uh so he does that and not knowing what to do with it he lays it on the ground again where he found it but when he turns around there’s hhh there’s a police man so not wanning to seem like he just abandoned his own baby he takes it again and walks away uh / yeah in the next scene there’s uh we can see him walking down the street ‘n’ there’s an old man with a cane and he our protagonist pretends that he has to tie his shoe so he gives the old man the baby and when the old man takes the baby he runs away uh the old man runs after him and uh the protagonist hides and the old man walks around with the baby also not knowing what to do with it and walks by uh the woman with the pram that we saw before and puts the baby into the pram and walks away and the our protagonist comes out of his uh his hide his place of uh hiding and wants to walk away but sees the uh police man again so he turns around ‘n’ walks off onto the other direction and when he walks past the uh woman with the pram uh the woman sees that there’s again a foreign baby in her pram and runs after the protagonist and beats him up and forces him to take the child and he take takes the child and walks away and then sits down on the curb of the street uh he opens a drain and seems to contemplate if he should put the baby in there and / leave but then he looks at the child and finds uh a note that says please love ‘n’ care for this orphan child and after that we can see him look at the baby and he takes the baby and walks away and that’s where the video ends
ok so in the video we see Charlie Chaplin walking down the street / uh really relaxed and then out of the window somebody drops some garbage uh which misses him first twice uh he just walks on ‘n’ then when he uh comes to a corner somebody else drops garbage out of a window which totally hits him ‘n’ is dropped on his head he is really embarrassed really startled by it of course and uh yeah looks up to the window where it came from uh to find it out and uh yeah then seems to be very embarrassed so he takes out some cigarettes or cigars and uh yeah starts smoking uh / he takes off his gloves and I think lights his cigarette on his shoe hhh a match on his shoe and then throws the gloves into the thrash can that is standing next to him he walks on ‘n’ at the corner he finds a baby that‘s lying there he picks it up and uh then quickly wants to put it back again / when I think a police man comes by / so he decides that he is not gonna put it back there of course and / walks / away hhh ‘n’ then / I think / he finds uh he sees a mother with a a pram and she has an older child in that pram like around two years or so and he she’s inside of a store she goes inside of a store ‘n’ he decides to put the baby in the pram with the other with the other child ‘n’ to yeah tries to sneak away when she comes out ‘n’ of course notices ‘n’ it she got really really angry ‘n’ to= tells him to to to take the baby with him again ‘n’ take it out of hhh her pram hhh and uh he does that I think the police officer also comes by ‘n’ she yells at the police officer that that Chaplin puts the baby inside of he= her pram ‘n’ he uh yeah uh goes away with the baby uh next scene we see is him walking down the street ‘n’ there is another man with a walking stick so quite slow and Charlie Chaplin pretends uh he he gives the child to the other man pretending that he has to tie his shoe laces ‘n’ then runs away and this other man is confused ‘n’ now has the baby in his arms uh next scene ‘n’ we see again I think the the pram of the same woman uh from before and the man with the walking stick puts the baby into the pram uh and goes away the woman isn’t there she doesn’t notice it and in that moment unfortunately Charlie Chaplin walks by the woman comes out and thinks that this baby in her pram is again hhh the baby that Chaplin put there / uh / that might be she gets really angry anyway and he has to take it out again he is really I think hhh sad that he has this baby ‘n’ can’t seem to get rid of it ‘n’ next scene we see him uh with this baby again sit down at the curb I think looking at the baby uh hhh next to him uh there’s a drain ‘n’ he considers it shortly to throw the baby into the drain opens it uh no doesn’t do it and then looks at the baby and uh s= finds a note in the in the blanket or the cloth or whatever hhh of the baby which says please love ‘n’ care for this orphan child so Chaplin looks at the baby and smiles at it kind of awkwardly ‘n’ then he stands up ‘n’ walks away with this baby ‘n’ then the video is over
uh in the film Charlie Chaplin is first seen walking down the street ‘n’ then he lights a cigarette and uh finds a baby in the corner of the street uh and it’s pretty obvious that he doesn’t wanna keep it he wants to get rid of it uh so then this uh woman walks passed him with a pram and a child uh and she goes into the shop and hhh while she is in the shop he puts the baby in the pram but uh she comes out ‘n’ sees it and tells him off uh ‘n’ then he’s stuck with the baby again then he gives it to another guy walking down the street uh and that guy also doesn’t know what to do with the baby so he puts it in the pram of the same woman uh in the meanwhile Charlie Chaplin also gets told off by a police officer uh after he’s tried putting the baby back in the corner hhh uh ‘n’ then the the lady tells him off again uh and the police officer also joins so Charlie Chaplin has to take the baby ‘n’ gets stuck with it again uh ‘n’ then he just sits down on the pavement ‘n’ puts down his walking stick hhh uh and he finds a note in the baby’s uh underneath the baby’s clothes or cloth whatever it’s wrapped up in and it says please care ‘n’ love or please love ‘n’ care for an orphan child and he just sits there for a second and uh gets up ‘n’ takes the baby ‘n’ that’s the end of the movie
hhh in the beginning of the scene we see a man walking through the streets when he finds a baby uh the male person picks up the baby and uh he seems confused not knowing what to do when he sees a lady walking by uh / he puts the baby in the stroller of the lady the lady seems irritated gets angry and hhh uh / seems to be irre= irritated as it it it seems not to be her child so the male person picks up the baby again walks off uh hhh / the / male character / thinks about putting the baby to the ground when h= he sees a police officer uh so he changes his mind uh picks up the baby again walks off the scene / in the next scene the male person holding the baby uh hhh tries to give the baby to another person another stranger uh the stranger takes the baby is confused seems to be confused himself when the male character who gave him the baby runs off the scene hhh in the next scene the stranger who is now holding the baby uh hhh seems to be confused himself sees a stroller and puts the baby in the stroller by coincidence the stroller is the same stroller stroller oh god I hhh uh hhh from the same woman from the scene uh from the beginning so when she comes out of the store and sees that the baby hhh / the the baby is in her stroller again she gets angry ‘n’ when she sees the male person from the beginning walking by she gets angry and begins to hhh beats the male person so in the end of the scene uh the male person is holding the baby again is contemplating about hhh is contemplating putting the baby to the ground again ‘n’ leaving it there when the male person finds a note attached to the baby the note says uh that the child is an orphanage an orphan / orphan child and that whoever finds the baby should care ‘n’ love the child this seems to make the person change his mind and he walks off the scene with the yeah holding the baby hhh
