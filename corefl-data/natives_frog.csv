Joey was very intrigued by the new frog and enjoyed watching it swim around inside its bowl. Even Spots was paying attention to the mysterious creature in the bowl. Eventually, Joey went to bed. That night, however, Jerry wanted to go see his family back in the pond. So while Joey slept soundly in his bed, Jerry climbed out of the bowl and quietly hopped back to the pond. However, Jerry did not realize that his exit from the bowl made a splashing sound which woke Joey up. Spots had also heard something akin to steps outside his crate downstairs. Spots ran upstairs to check on Joey and the two were perplexed when they looked at the now empty bowl. The next day, they went outside in search of Jerry. Looking through the nearby park and at the edge of the woods, Joey and Spots called out for Jerry but to no avail. Eventually, Joey crawled over a deer with Spots following close behind him. They were both tossed off the deer's head into a pond. As Joey and  Spots emerged from the water, they climbed over a nearby tree trunk. Joey was sad he could not find his new pet. Once they had dried off, though, Joey looked to the side and saw Jerry with his family. Joey realized that Jerry was better off in the wild living with his family.

Penny tried to ask for the gentleman frog's given name in her most polite voice, but James reproached Penny for barking and seemed content to spend the evening without even attempting conversation, so Mr. Frog suffered through a most improper silence until James' bedtime.  <br/> It was the middle of the night, and a gentle breeze was wafting through the open window, when Penny heard a soft, reedy voice from the windowsill:  <br/> ""Pardon this unmannerly exit, ma'am,"" whispered Mr. Frog, ""but I really must be getting home to my family."" <br/> Penny nodded briefly, not wanting to wake James, and the gentleman frog disappeared into the night.  <br/> The next morning, James was distraught to find Mr. Frog missing from his glass jar, despite Penny's reassurances that their guest was really all right.  <br/> ""Where did he go?"" cried James. ""What if he is lost in the forest?"" <br/> ""Mr. Frog went home to his family,"" said Penny. <br/> ""Oh, don't bark, Penny,"" said James. ""I know you must be worried, but we'll find him and bring him home."" <br/> ""He's already home,"" said Penny.  <br/> ""Shh, Penny,"" said James.  <br/> Since James could not be convinced of Mr. Frog's safety, Penny's only choice was to accompany her human into the forest in pursuit of their recent guest. Like most humans, James went about making an unbelievable amount of noise, calling for ""Froggy!"" incessantly and stepping on every loud twig that could possibly lie in his path. <br/> ""I rather think 'Froggy' is a disrespectful moniker,"" said Penny. ""Also, oughtn't we check the pond first?"" <br/> ""That's right, girl,"" said James. ""You call for Froggy too! Keep barking!"" <br/> ""What izz your human doing, what izz he looking for?"" asked several bees from a nearby hive. <br/> ""We had a run-in with a gentleman frog last night; I didn't catch his name,"" Penny explained. ""My human seems intent on finding him again, though I'm not sure he knows where to look."" <br/> The commotion brought Tom Weasel wiggling out of his house to laugh uproariously at the sight of James calling into the hollows of Owl Tree. <br/> ""Does your human know ANYTHING about animals?"" said Tom, wheezing with laughter. ""All he's going to get out of that is a very angry Mrs. Owl - she's just gone down for a nap, just watch - "" <br/> Sure enough, Virginia Owl soon appeared in her tree's branches, although James had since moved on to the large rock at the front door of another house. One of Virginia's eyes was still closed, and her beak was downturned in a fantastically sleepy scowl. She took a deep breath.  <br/> ""WHO,"" bellowed Virginia. She paused to yawn. ""WHO dares -"" <br/> ""FROGGY WHERE ARE YOU?"" yelled James.  <br/> Tom snickered so loudly that Penny took it upon herself to forcefully remind him of his manners, and as such, almost missed the sudden hush that swept through the whole clearing. Even James fell silent, which was sufficiently strange for Penny to go immediately running to her human's side, but she found him sprawled helplessly over Sir Roland Buck's wide face and rising steadily as the buck stood up.  <br/> ""Oh, for the love of all good creatures in this forest,"" said Sir Roland in his slow, rumbling way.  <br/> ""Sir, I apologize,"" yelped Penny. ""My human - "" <br/> ""Yes, yes,"" said Sir Roland, while James clung to his antlers, terrified. ""Come along.""  <br/> It turned out that the pond was much closer than Penny remembered from her last trip to the forest, which was comforting. She did think that Sir Roland could have dropped her and James off in a less literal fashion, though."

As he was peering into the bushes, he felt something move beneath him. All of a sudden, Tommy was lifted high into the air on his belly, a massive buck beneath him. The buck was very unhappy to find Tommy perched upon his head, so he tossed him off, Tommy landing in the pond nearby with a splash. Sputtering, he sat up, pushing his wet hair out of his eyes to reassess his surroundings. It was then that he heard a croak. Tommy immediately thought of Samuel and began to search the pond's surroundings. Not a minute went by before another croak was issued from behind a large log. Tommy rounded the corner, and to his surprise not only saw Samuel, but an entire family of frogs. This must be Samuel's wife and kids, Tommy thought. He decided that Samuel would be much happier here with his family than in the jar that Tommy had for him at home. With this bittersweet knowledge, Tommy said farewell to his new friend and headed home after promising to visit him often. Even though Tommy knew he couldn't raise Samuel as his own, he was still happy to know that the frog was safe and with his family.

He brought the frog in his jar to his room and spent all afternoon watching the frog with his pet dog. The frog was afraid of the dog and didn't much like his jar, so he hatched a plan of escape. That night, while the boy and the dog were sleeping, the frog climbed out of the jar and hopped away. When the boy woke up, he realized that his frog had gone missing. He was in a panic and immediately turned the house upside-down in search. The boy realized that the frog must not be in the house, so he and his dog went outside to search. They called for the frog into the woods, ""Frog! Frog, where are you?"" but he didn't come back. The boy and the dog headed into the forest to search. High and low, left and right, in a tree, on a rock- the two searched everywhere. The boy just couldn't find his frog. He did, however, find a new animal: a huge buck. The buck didn't like the boy's intrusion into his territory, and rapidly threw him over a short ledge. The boy and his dog landed with a thud in a soft march. When he got up and brushed himself off, the boy noticed a whole family of frogs watching him curiously. Among them he saw his pet frog. He had found him! His pet, touched that the boy had gone through so much to find him, decided to go back home with the boy and his dog. They waved goodbye to the frog family and trekked back home, where the three became great friends and lived HOPpily ever after."

They would sometimes get lost in their imaginary games for hours. One day in the middle of the summer as Eleanor and Buster were looking for dragon eggs in a calm pool on the edge of the river a frog hopped right onto Eleanor's shoulder. Eleanor was enchanted with her new friend, who spoke to her about life as a frog and how he had traveled all the way down the stream to the Big Pond and there were pirates in the big pond. Buster was dubious about trusting the Frog, and he was a little jealous of the interest Eleanor had her new friend. He made it clear that he was not interested in being the Frog's friend. Eleanor invited the Frog up to her house for a sleep over. She prepared his bowl and fed him a big supper. Buster, was still not delighted by the Frog's presence. He did not believe that the Frog had ever been down to the Big Pond or that there were pirates there. Once Eleanor fell alseep the Frog decided to leave. While he enjoyed Eleanor's company, he felt like Buster didn't like him. When Eleanor and Buster woke up and the Frog was gone Eleanor became worried that the Frong was kidnapped. She insisted that Buster come with her to help her find the Frog. Buster was reluctant but goes along to support his best friend. The two went further down the stream than they have ever been. They saw strange new animals, and felt a little afraid when they didn't recognize where they were. The area was all new, but Eleanor insisted that finding the Frog is essential. Eventually Eleanor decided to stop and rest on top of a little ledge. She saw some black berries and went to reach for them, but suddenly she found herself on top of a deer. The deer was so startled that he flicked his head and she went flying into a body of water. Buster jumped in right after her. When they resurfaced they realized that they must be in the Big Pond. The Frog noticed the disruption from the other side of the pond and swam over immediately to investigate and help out. The three realized what had happened and were simultaneously irritated and touched. The Frog apologized for being rude and not leaving a note and lying about the pirates. He said that he would be lucky to have Eleanor and Buster as his friends. Buster apologized for not being nice to the Frog. Eleanor forgave Buster for being grumpy, and the Frog for exaggerating the truth.

While the boy was sleeping, the frog got up and jumped out of his bowl and went away. When the boy awoke the next morning, he was very sad to find out that the frog wasn’t there anymore. To try and cheer himself up, he went out looking for the frog. He went out to his backyard, but he couldn’t find the frog there. He went and searched the forest, but he also couldn’t find the frog there. To get better ground, he stood on top of a rock to shout for the frog. When he shouted the first time, a mean and evil deer scooped the boy up and threw him into a river, knocking the boy out. Upon waking up, the boy gathered his surroundings and propped himself up on a log. Looking around, he noticed some new animals he has never seen before, like a squirrel.

Before going to bed, Pete put the frog in an empty jam jar, to examine it the following morning. In the middle of the night, the frog whom Pete decided to name Clementi, found it's way out of the jar and bounced his way back to the park. The moment the sun came out, Pete anxiously got up to greet his new little friend, and maybe feed him some delicious breakfast flies, but to his horror little Clementi was no longer there. Pete quickly got dressed and him and Albus followed the trail back to park were they had found Clementi. They looked for him everywhere. As Albus howled across the wildflower fields, Pete shouted  ""Clemeti, Clementi where are you, you toad?"", but the only ones that replied where the noisy black sparrows that flew off slightly annoyed.  <br/> Clementi wasn't in a hole in a tree either, and he wasn't near the beehive that clumsy Albus knocked down... Pete was about  to give up, when he decided to climb a big rock to see if he could spot him from up high. He repeated his howl, ""Clemeti, Clementi where are you, you  frog?"". Suddenly a deer leaped from behind the rocks and pushed Pete and poor Albus of a cliff. They both fell and  plunged to a shallow pond. Albus dragged drowsy Pete so he could latch on to a floating hollow log,  which was quite unnecessary since the pond was barely five inches deep. Pete regained consciousness thanks to the slobberness of Albus's incessant lick. Slowly, a blurry image became clear, and Pete now took notice on what he had in front of him. A big Papa frog, next to it a smaller Mama frog and half a dozen baby frogs, all staring at him with their big squishy eyes. Pete realized Papa frog was his lost friend Clementi, except he was no longer lost. He had returned home to the empty log where he and his family lived. Pete felt sad to leave his friend behind, but knew he was much needed at home with his family. Albus and Pete set themselves off their way back home, as Clementi began to sing. Joined by the rest of his family, they choired a tune goodbye.  <br/>  <br/> The End."

Carefully scooping the frog up, he popped him in the pocket of his coat and treaded home, Chewbaca leading the way. Tommy named the frog Freddie and cared for him well, ensuring that Freddie was well fed. Tommy tucked Freddie up in a glass bowl for the night, himself climbing into his bed where Chewbaca settled at his feet.  <br/> As the moon rose, Tommy and Chewbaca slept soundly, breathing deeply. However, Freddie had other ideas.

Throwing on his coat and wellies, Tommy charged out of the house, with Chewbaca hot on his heels. Tommy was worried that Freddie would get lost, or even worse, eaten! Tommy shouted; Chewbaca howled. Tommy climbed up into a tree for a better view; Chewbaca scrabbled. They climbed, they crawled, they trip-trapped over streams, and they got into all sorts of scrapes! Tommy and Chewbaca were causing so much of a racket in the quiet wood that other animals came out to see what the fuss was about. One particularly disgruntled elk even barged Tommy off a rock and Tommy landed splash into the stream! Fortunately, Tommy wasn't hurt and was guarded from further harm by Chewbaca. Then, over the trickle of the stream and the gentle rustling of the wind, Tommy and Chewbaca heard a croak. And then another croak. And another. Tommy and Chewbaca poked their heads over the log next to the stream and to their surprise saw not only Freddie but his family!

Its magic had dissipated- now that its surroundings were normal, the frog looked out of place, and far from home.

Johnny crawled up trees, he climbed up rocks, he called out to the little frog but he was nowhere to be found.  <br/>  <br/> As he was calling out for the little frog, all of a sudden, a large animal came bursting up the rock where he was standing, charging at him and sending him and his dog flying off the rock and into the water below! They landed in the stream with a big splash! Just on the other side of the stream there sat a hallow log. Johnny decided to crawl up on the log, thinking it could be the perfect place to find his little frog. As he pulled himself up over the log and looked on the other side, he was pleased to find that there sat, not only his little frog that he had found and captured, but a little family of frogs of all different sizes.  <br/>  <br/> Johnny leaned down and scooped up one of the little ones into his hands to carry home again and keep in a little jar for himself. As Johnny and Bashful were crossing the stream to head home, they looked back and waved goodbye to the other frogs who were now perched on top of the log, looking out at them as they headed off. They would miss their little son but knew that he would be safe with his new friend who loved him very much.
