He gets hit with trash, a mixture of dirt and rock, that was thrown from the window of an overhead apartment. He then sighs and smokes a cigarette. Shortly after he sees a baby abandoned on the side of the hazardous street. He quickly picks up the baby, as he turns around he spots a mother with a stroller. He mistakenly thinks that the baby most be hers and puts the baby in the stroller while the mother is in the store. However, when she comes back from the story she becomes very angry and tells him to take the baby back. He does and then tries to return the baby to where he found it. However, he sets the baby down in the sight of a police officer who assumes that the man is abandoning the baby. The man quickly picks the baby up again. Multiple attempts of the man trying to get rid of the baby ensues. The man tries to pass the baby off to another man, who then puts the baby in the same stroller as the woman before. The man who originally has the baby walks past the mother who thinks he has once again set the baby in her stroller. The mother attacks the man who originally had the baby with an umbrella. He claims the baby once again. After walking with the baby for some time, the man sits down with the baby on a curb. For a split second he considers putting the baby into the sewer. He doesn't think he can handle the burden of a baby. However, he finds a note on the baby with a written request that whoever finds the baby loves and cares for it. The note changes his mind completely and he decides to care for the baby.

He didn't know what to do but when he saw a women with a carriage, he thought it was hers and gave it back. It wasn't the women's baby and so he had to take it back. He then tried to put the baby back where he found it but then a police officer showed up so he picked up the baby and kept walking. While walking he saw another man and asked him to hold the baby. He ran away and the man was startled and went looking for him with the baby. The man walked past the same lady from earlier with the carriage and put the baby in it and left. Then Chaplin happened to be walking right past the carriage the the lady came out and she thought that he put the baby in the carriage again. So, he took the baby back because the police officer showed up. Then he sat down with the baby on a curb and thought about putting it in the sewer. While sitting with the baby he read a note that said the baby was an orphan. Finally, he decided to walk away with the baby.

Bricks fell down from the building, something was shot at him. He then found a baby lying on the ground. He picked up the baby wondering where it had come from. He later then noticed a lady walking by with a stroller and he put the baby inside her stroller when she wasn't looking. The woman got mad and he took the baby back, because although she was in search of a baby; this was not her baby. He then picked it up and went on his way, and didn't leave the baby because of the cop watching his every move. Later on, the man gave the baby to another older man who put the baby back into the same woman's stroller. The main man happened to walk by and the woman freaked out and got mad again.

The woman however, upon placement of the orphaned child in her stroller she was upset because she did not want to have to care for another baby. Thus, the man put the baby back where he found it, however, due to his poor luck there was a police man right behind him so man couldn't just place the babe back where he found it and therefore he gave the baby off to someone else.

He was caught by the woman trying to abandon the abandoned child in stroller and was still left with the child.  Afterwards he tried to place the baby back where it was originally found, but was seen by a police officer and given the context of  the sight of a man placing a baby on the street Charlie grabbed the baby and continued to try to find him a home.  While walking, he found a man and swindled him into holding the baby and quickly ran away.  Coincidently enough, the man placed the baby in the same carriage that Charlie had earlier.  Later when the woman realized she once again had two babies, she was furious and saw Charlie walking and assumed he had placed the abandoned baby in her stroller again.  In the end after man attempts of trying to abandoned baby, it finally found a home with Charlie after the goofy man with the mustache realized that the child was an orphan.

He then lights a cigarette and turns around to find a crying baby by the garbage. He immediately picks up the baby and attempts to place it in the baby carriage of a woman walking by, telling her that she dropped something. The woman is obviously aware that the man had placed the baby in the carriage himself, so she demands that he take the baby. He then tries to put it back where he found it, only to be caught by a police officer. He makes several more attempts to get rid of the baby, but is caught each time. Eventually, he sits down with the baby, reaches into its blanket, and finds a note asking to please take care of the orphan.

She refused and threatened him, so he took the baby back. He tried to put the baby back where he found it but a policeman saw him, so he had to take the baby back again. Then he saw an old man walking along the street and asked the man to hold the baby for a moment while he tied his shoe. The man agreed, and Charlie quickly ran away and hid. The man put the baby in the same woman's baby carriage. She came out, saw the baby, and then saw Charlie walking by and beat him with her umbrella until he took the baby back (she thought Charlie had put the baby in her carriage again!). The same policeman came over, and Charlie took the baby again. He went to go sit on a curb and considered dumping the baby down a sewer drain. However, he found a note in the baby's blanket that said ""please love and care for this orphan child."" This warmed his heart, and so he took the baby with him."

There isnâ€™t anyone else around so he tries to find the parent or caretaker of the child to return it. He tries to give it to a woman who has another child and a large carriage for children but she clearly isnâ€™t the mother because she refuses to take it. Then when going to return the child back to where he found it, a police officer arrives and it looks like Charlie is abandoning the child in the street so he keeps it again. Charlie gives the child to a random man in the street, who then puts it into the carriage of the woman from earlier. She then forces Charlie to keep the baby. Finally he finds a note that asks whoever is reading to love and care for this orphan child and Charlie walks away with it in hand.

Feeling sorry for the abandoned child, he picks the child up and looks around to see if it belongs to anyone. Seeing a mother with a stroller, he tries to leave the child with her. However, she does not want it either and forces him to keep it. He returns to the spot where he found the child and tries to put it back. Suddenly, a police officer appears and he is forced to keep the child once again. Next, he tricks and older gentleman into taking the child and then runs away. The older gentleman tries to follow, but loses him. Ironically, he ends up next to the mother's stroller and he puts the baby in there and leaves. As the man that found the child first walks past the stroller the mother comes out of the store and sees the abandoned child. She hits the man with her umbrella and forces him to take the child. The man finds a note stating the child is an orphan. The story ends with the man keeping the child.

Then he paused to light a cigarette and as he was smoking he noticed a baby on the ground, crying.  He debated picking up the baby but then he does.  After he picks up the baby he notices a woman with a stroller already carrying a baby, so he thinks it is hers and leaves the baby in her stroller.  The woman comes out and yells at Chaplin, telling him it's not hers.  He then grabs the baby and is about to put it back where he found it, but there is a policeman behind him.  Chaplin takes the baby and gives it to an old man, who once again finds the woman's stroller and puts it in there.  The woman comes out of the store and thinks that Chaplin put it there again because he was passing by as she came out.  They get in a disagreement and Chaplin takes the baby again as the policeman shows up.  Chaplin sits on the side walk, debating whether or not to put the baby in the sewer.  He sees a note on the baby's blanket telling him to love and care for the orphan child.  Finally, he decides to keep the child and walks away.

We can tell it is a comedic piece right from the start as he walks down the street and bricks fall on him from the sky, and his walking stick is apparently bendy. He also then manages to use his shoe to light his cigarette. The story then takes a turn when we spot an abandoned child lying on the street. Chaplin spots the baby and picks it up in search of it's mother. A woman then walks by with a pram and and Chaplin assumes the baby belongs there and so tries to put the baby in the pram. The woman is shocked and irritated. At a loss Chaplin takes the child and goes to put them back in the alleyway, but just at that moment is halted by a policeman. In order to avoid getting into trouble Chaplin picks the baby back up and walks around the street to dump the child in another man's arms, running away. The man spots the very same woman that Chaplin had tried to leave the baby with before and he successfully leaves the child in the pram while the woman is inside a shop. Just as the woman exits the shop and spots the child in the pram again Chaplin walks past. He then gets in trouble with the woman again and is forced to take the child back out of the pram. At a loss he sits down on the curb with the child and finds a slip of paper in the baby's wrappings. The note states the child is an orphan and to please love and care for them. Chaplin has a change of heart and is last seen walking away with the child smiling.

He picks the baby up in his arms, walks around, and notices a baby carriage a few feet away. He walks over and places the baby in the carriage. A woman comes out of the building and sees him standing by the carriage, which belongs to her. He believes that she left the child there, but she insists that the child is not hers.
