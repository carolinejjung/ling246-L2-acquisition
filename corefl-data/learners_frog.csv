Later, when the boy and the dog are sleeping peacefully, the frog escapes out of the glass. When the two sleepers are awake, they realise that the frog is gone. They get out in the forest and are yelling for the frog. While the boy climbes on a tree for searching the frog there, the dog hits the house of bees what makes them angry. They are searching everywhere, on rocks, under rocks. Suddenly, while the boy is still on the rock, he gets hit by a deer and falls down a small cliff. The dog also falls and both of them are landing in a river. A broken tree that comes by is their help in danger because they catch it and make it out of the river. After all this trouble, they find a small frog familiy where his particular frog is jumping immediately in the boys direction. The boy, with the frog in his hand, and the dog are leaving, waving goodbye to the rest of the frog family.

The frog seemed to be hurt so right away the boy decided to take the poor animal home with him. After they have walked all the way back home and put the frog in a big glass jar the boy and his dog wanted the frog to recover from all the stress he had. It was a lon exhausting day so the boy and dog went to bed to catch some sleep. Waking up the next morning the boy worringly could see that the hurt frog has disappeared. He grabbed his dog and ran ourside to look everywhere for the little animal. Behind the trees in all the bushes and little holes but they couldn't find the frog anywere. The boy decided to climb on a big rock to have a better overview. Suddenly he fell over and landed in the bushes. What he didnt know was that there was a massive deer in there and he basicly fell on the deer's head. Reacting shocked and wanting to protect itself the deer ran after the boy and dog and pushed them down a small cliff. Luckily they landed in a lake so they didnt get hurt at all. The boy and dog carred themselves out of the water and because they were so exhausted of searching for their little frog friend they leaned over an old fallen down tree.What they were able to see behind this tree was unbelievable.There he was their little frog, looking at them and seeming to be alright again. He wasn't even alone, no, he was with his frog girlfriend and children. The boy and dog were so happythey have found him and were even more pleased about the fact that the fog has a lovely family that cares for him.

It was his second pet, because he also got a dog. In the evening he went to bed and the next morninghe was very shocked. His little frog escaped during nighttime out of his bowl. The boy was very sad and began searching for him everywhere. His doggy helped him. He wandered through the forest nearby, screaming the name of the frog, climbed up the trees and searched behind big rocks. But he couldn't find him anywhere.Suddenly a big reindeer jumped out of a bush. The boy was so scared and surprised at the same time that he fell into a little pond. He and his dog swam to the land and continued searching for his beloved frog. He saw a big fallen trunk and climbed behind it and there he saw a big frog family with many little frog children. He recognized his little frog among the kids. But he realised that the frog was happy in the wilderness happier than he would be in the glass bowl at home. So he and his dog decided to let the frog live together with his family in the forest. Sometimes they would come and see if they would be still there and they could visit them. So the boy and his dog waved to say goodbye and went home.

It is already dark outside because the moon shines through the window. As the boy and the dog are seeping, the frog climbs out of the jar, because the boy left it open to let the frog breathe. Without anything to cover it, the frog easily frees itself and escapes through the open window into the night. When the boy and dog wake the next day, the find the jar empty. They run out in the woods to look for the frog. They call out to it, but it is nowhere to be found. They even put themselves into dangerand get attacked by bees. The boy climbs trees and rocks and calls out for the frog, but it does not return to him. Standing on the rock, the boy did not notice an elk approaching. He entered the elk's territory and now the big animal attacks him. The throws him down the rock and into a lake. Luckily the water is very shallow so the boy doesn't drown.Yet he is soaking wet. Nevertheless he continues his search for his frog and looks behind a fallen tree, laying on the ground. There he finally finds the frog. He then notices the frog is the father of a frog family and he wanted to return to his wife and children.

When the boy went to sleep, the frog managed to escape his prison and fled into nature In the morning, the boy and the dog noticed the frog's escape and went out to look for him. They ventured out into the wilderness, called his name and looked everywhere - without any success. Eventually, the boy climbed upon a rock and accidentally grabbed the horn of an elk, who rested in front of the rock. Unterstandibly, the elk was not very pleased by this unvoluntary interaction with the human species. Consequently, he threw him and his dog into a creek.

After some days, while Benny was asleep the frog climbed out of the glass and left the house. Neither Benny nor Bunker were able to understand why the frog had left when they realized he had gone. Therefore, Benny and Bunker decided to look for the frog. They went into a nearby forest and shouted in the woods. Benny climbed a tree and a rock. Suddenly the rock turned out to be an elk. The elk rose so that Benny and Bunker were tossed down a cliff. They fell into a pond. After getting out of the water they sat down on a trunk. Coincidentally looking around, Benny saw the frog. Yet the frog was not alone. There were eight frogs sitting in a circle. Now Benny understood. He could not be the frog's friend or family as the frog already had one. So Benny and Bunker decided to leave the frogs alone and waved to say goodbye. They returned home and thought about their little adevnture.

The frog is in a glass so that he will not leave, but he seems quite happy. With them, there is a dog, who also seems to like the little frog. In fact, they seem to be really interested in the its behaviour.  <br/>  When the little boy goes to sleep at night, the little frog decides to leave. Since the glass has been left open, he can easily escape.  <br/>  The next morning, the boy wakes up and is shocked: The little frog is gone! Consequently, he decides to look for him and goes into the woods. He calls his frog's name, but does not get any reply. His dog and him try to find their friend in various places: they even have a look into a tree. During their time in the forest, the boy tries to look everywhere and even gets into an interesting situation with a deer, who throws him into water. Now it becomes clear that the little boy really has to go through a lot to find his friend. In the end, he looks behind a tree and finds the frog he has been looking for. His little friend is surrounded by other frogs, possibily his family. Lastly, the young boy leaves with the dog and waves the frogs goodbye. Obviously, he has agreed to let him live with his family and goes home without him.

Otis was kept in a jar on the floor. On this certain day the little boy forgot to close the jar properly and Otis escaped the jar and then the whole house. When the little boy noticed that his green friend was gone he was shocked and decided to search for him in the park near his house. Butter and the little boy shouted after Otis and searched everywhere. In beeholes, on trees on stones. However, Otis was nowhere to be found. One of the stoneswhich the little boy climbed upon was so high that he had to grab the stitches of a near tree. At least that was he had thought. In fact, the stitches were part of a forest animal that pushed Butter and him into the lake. Luckily both of them were good swimmers and and it did not take them long to rescue themselves. They were absolutely suprised when they found Otis on the other side of the lake. By his side there was another frog and a bunch of tiny frog babies. So that was where Otis had run to! Empathetic as he was, the little boy congratulated Otis, and Butter and him left with a heartwarming farewell.

Their search also led them through the forest. To get an overview, the boy climbed on a rock and held onto a branch. Turns out, that it was no branch, he was holing onto - It was a deer, that lifted the boy up and threw him and his dog into a lake. The two got out of the lake and after climbing over a tree stem, lying on the ground, they discovered a little frog familiy. Their befriended frog was one of them.

When the boy woke up in the morning, he was shocked not finding his frog in the glass. He missed him and was sad because of all the adventures that he planned to have with the frog and that now would never happen, since the frog was not there anymore. The boy decided to go outside and look for his frog with the dog. They went to the fields and forests and screamed the little frogs name as loud as their bodies were able to. But they couldn't find the frog. Neither in the fields, nor in the forests. Not even inside of any tree the little boy climed into. The frustrated little boy saw a rock that was not to big for him to climb it and just big enough to be able to look over the bushes when standing on it. Unluckily a deer was hiding behind the rock, wanting to spend some time alone. As the dear was not amused for a shouting little boy to disturb his peace, it took the little boy on his head and pushed him and his little dog into the nearby river. The two fell into the river and escaped soaking wet to the next piece of wood that was lying on the riverside. When they managed to get on the other side of the piece of wood to save themselves, they found the little frog they were searching for sitting on the ground. The frog was visiting his family, which also sat on the ground, looking up to the boy and the dog. The frog decided to come back home with the boy and the dog, thinking that he had spend enough holiday time and being exhausted from the long walk around the forest. The boy, the dog and the frog friendly waved goodbye, as they were heading back home.

One day they caught a frog and put it inside a glass. They watched it all evening. It was very fascinating. When it was time to go to sleep, they both went to bed, while the frog was still inside the glass in front of the bed. In the night the frog crawled out of its glass. The next morning Timmy and Spencer woke up and were excited to play with the frog, but unfortunately they found an empty glass. Hence they immediately went outside to look for the missing frog. Timmy and Spencer went out into the woods, climbed onto trees and rocks, however they couldn't find the frog. As Timmy and Spencer climbed onto a rock, a deer suddenly appeared and shoved them into a little pond. Luckily they were able to swim and got out of the water. Thereupon they climbed onto a trunk of a tree. When they heard a sound that seemed to be the croaking of frogs, they looked behind the trunk. Surprisingly they discovered the frog and its family! Afterwards they all played together all day long and had lots of fun!

One night Timmy and his two pets - a puppy named Bo and a green frog named Tammy - were sitting on the floor of his bedroom and listening to the dark night and the whisper of the wind. As usual Tammy was captured in a glass jar, so the frog would not run away (which she loved to do when noone was looking). Later that night Timmy went to bed, and even Bo managed to get some sleep, even though thunder and wind of the night were knocking at the bedroom's window. Suddenly Tammy the frog silently climed out of her glass jar and escaped through the half open window into the darkness. The next morning Timmy and Bo woke up in utter shock. They realized the second that they opened their eyes that something was different: Tammy had escaped and left them. The frog was gone and off to her very own adventure. Timmy and Bo started looking for the frog in the nearby forrest. They yelled her Name ""Tammy, Tammy"" over and over again, but noone answered. When they got deeper into the dark woods, there still was no sight of the green, little frog. Finally, Timmy climed a big rock to get a better view of his surroundings. Just as he started to yell out ""Tammy"" again, a deer suprised him. The gigantic animal lifted poor little Timmy up and carried the boy a few steps away. Sad little Bo had to watch the deer dropping his friend in the cold waters of the nearby river. Bo also fell into the water in a desperate attempt to save Timmy. The boy fell head down first into the water - it was quite a rough landing. However: Luckily Timmy and Bo both survived and found themselves laying on a floating tree stem. Both of them laughted again and were very happy to find themselves alive. But not only this. When the tree stem floated a little bit further, Timmy and Bo caught sight of frog Tammy. They could not believe their eyes when they saw the Tammy was now a wife of another green frog and had a couple of children to her side as well. Timmy was incredibly happy to find his friend alive and so happy with her very own family. He decided to leave Tammy in the forrest, where she could live happily ever after with her own frog-family. And so did Timmy and his little dog, when they ultimately returned home to his house by the forrest."

Where was his froggy? Together with his dog he tried to figure out where he could have gone but all this thinking and not doing anything about it killed the boy.

It was a deer with his giant antlers who carried him to a cliff and threw him off the edge. The poor boy fell into a river where he struggled not to drown.

Until someday the little frog slipped out of his bottle and ran away from home. When the boy realized the frog's disappearance, he was shocked and went outside with his dog to look for him. He shouted his frog's name and looked into treeholes, while the dog destroyed a home of bees. The search seemed hopeless until the boy climbed up a rock to get a better view. Then something pushed him off the cliff and while he was falling, he saw that a deer was responsible for it. The child fell into a swamp, where his dog already waited and pulled him to land.

Froggy, Fro-hog, Mr. Frog,"" Timmy shouted towards the trees. Jasper went looking at the smaller places, even met some bees who were nice enough not to sting him, and Timmy went for the bigger hiding places, climbed trees and big rocks. Because the rock was covered in moss, Timmy grabbed a treebranch to hold on to. But, oh no! That wasn't a treebranch, it was a deer standing behind the rock. Timmy fell over onto its head and grabbed his crown harder. The deer didn't like that very much and started running and jumping to get little Timmy off his head. He stopped right before a small cliff so harshely, that Timmy couldn't hold on much longer and fell over into a little pond below. Luckily Jasper found him sitting in the cold, muddy water and helped him to get out. But, what was that? Timmy had heard a loud, familiar sound. Behind a dead treestem he looked for the noisemaker. It was his frog and - wow - his little frogfamily. ""Good morning, Mr. Frog, Mrs Frog and you little froggy baby's."", Timmy whispered not to scare them. One of the baby frogs really wasn't scared at all. He hopped towards Timmy and said ""Ribbit!"" Jasper seemed surprised but a second after he licked the small frog all over its back. Timmy heard a grumpling sound from somewhere down and felt his tummy and suddenly also his hunger. As he stood up, he saw the little frog jumping towards him and caught him in his hand.

While he was on a rock a deer appeared and pushed both, the boy and the dog into a lake.  <br/>  When they could finally rescue themselves, they climbed on a dead tree to get out of the water. When the boy looked down, he saw the frog and the frog's family sitting benath the tree. The boy was so happy to have found the frog and his family that he left him where he was and went home.

For Henry it was fascinating to see how animals behave and he had watched several animals before.  <br/>  A few hours later, Henry went to sleep and left his window open. The frog took his chance and jumped out of the glass in which he was captured. He wanted to go home to his family.  <br/>  The next day, Henry and Bob noticed that the frog was gone. Henry was really sad because it had took them over an hour to catch the frog. Henry decided to go to the forest after breakfast and see if he could find the frog somewhere.  <br/>  In the forest, they shouted the name of the frog (they had called him Luke) and searched for him even in trees, although they knew that it was not likely to find Luke in a tree. Henry wanted to find Luke so desperately that he climbed a very dangerous-looking rock to have a better view over the forest.  <br/>  Suddenly a stag came out of the bushes and pushed Henry and Bob into the river. Fortunately, there was a dead tree in the river so that they did not drown but could rescue themselves. <br/>   Sitting on the tree, they suddenly noticed a little frog family watching them. Henry saw that it was Luke with his wife and his six little children. Henry knew that this was the place where Luke belonged, not in the glass in his bedroom. Slowly, Henry and Bob turned away and waved the little family goodbye. Then they went home and Henry decided that he would only watch animals in their natural environment from now on.

They had been on many adventures together but this evening they are looking at one very interesting finding. They found a big frog and managed to catch him using a glass jar. They took a close look at him before going to sleep but the frog managed to escaoe. After waking up the boy is quite surprised to see the empy jar and so he went out with his dog to find his frog again. They went out into the forest where they found him last day and searched for him everywhere. The dog used his nose to look for traces the frog might have left and the boy tried climbing on trees and rocks while loudly shouting out to the frog. However, a stag felt disturbed by all this noise so he grabbed the boy while he was standing on top of a rock and tossed him into the nearby waters using his big antlers. The boy and his dog managed to get out of the water by using a drifting log and swimming back to the land on it. Luckily for them, right there where they got the ground back on their feet they found the frog, happily standing next to his wife and his many children. The frog was very impressed by the many troubles they took onto themselves just to find him once again and even though he did not like being in captivity he was now convinced that also his children can learn a lot from the boy and his braveness so he offered one of his children to him. Maybe one day little frog jr. will return back to his father and be just as adventerous and brave as our boy and his dog following every step he makes

James decided to take the frog home and put it into a big glass. He was so curious about this kind of aninmal that he sat in front of the glass the whole day, watching the frog, accomanied by his dog. In the evening he was so tired of such an interesting and exciting day that he fell asleep early, without checking if the glass was closed properly. At night the frog escaped the glass and when James and his dog woke up the next morning, the frog had dissapeared. James took his best best friend with the cold and wet nose and ran into the forest searching for the frog. They searched everywhere they could think of. Since they could not find the frog, James decided to hike on a big stone where he saw an elk and fell on it. The elk was very mad and pushed him down a little hill. James and his dog fell into a small lake and as they wanted to get out of the water with the help of a fallen tree, he suddenly saw the frog. He was very happy about this and wanted to take it home with him again but then he realized that the frog was surrounded by its family and seemed very happy. James made up his mind and cleared his thoughts. He could not take him away from his beloved ones again. Therefore, he decided to leave the frog with its family and left the forest with his dog. In the end, the frog lived happy with its family and James learned that it is sometimes better to leave his own wants behind to help others and make others happy.

Frog	written_online	""	Inside classroom	""	"Once upon a time, in a country formerly known as the United States of America, there was a little boy, growing up in a world that was very different from anything we know today. There was nothing much left, so the boy, by the name of Tommy, had to be very creative and had to constantly come up with new ideas to keep himself busy and make his life as exciting as possible. His parents worked a lot, so his best companion was a dog, by the name of Pilot. Tommy and Pilot did everything together and eventhough Pilot wasn't able to articulate his feelings verbally, Tommy knew what he was thinking at all times.  <br/>  One morning they woke up to examine what they had caught the day before: a frog. Both studied this little creature in awe, for frogs were not easy to find these days. Yet, the frog managed to escape out of the Jar Tommy had put him in. He couldn't believe his eyes when he realised that once again it was only him and Pilot left alone. But what if something happened to him, tommy thought, and decided to go and look for him. They searched the entire house, the garden, under the bed...nothing. It didn't make sense to Tommy. Why would his new friend leave him and Pilot, when he has a better life here? They went out to the forest and started to search in bushes, behind and inside trees, yet they still couldn't find him. Altough Tommy wasn't the tallest boy, he had the courage to climb up big rocks and trees. That must be friendship, Pilot thaught, and continued to look for his new friend. <br/>  As Tommy was standing on the rock, a malicious animal came from behind and pushed him aggressively. It turned out to be a deer. Tommy had never seen these kinds of animals before. Since everything was not as it had been in the country, formerly known as the USA, these animals were hardly ever seen in the forest. Tommy and Pilot were scarred and didn't quite know what to do. They both managed to run away and hide for a while. While they were hiding, Tommy took the chance to examine the environment around him. Suddenly he jumped up and started to wave his hands in excitement. ""We found him, Pilot! Look! We found him!"" On the other side was the frog with his whole family waiting for Tommy and Pilot. Tommy and Pilot felt relieved. All those struggles to find their new best friends weren't for nothing.  <br/>  Tommy, Pilot and the Frog(-family) became close friends. Everyday they would visit each other and go on adventures. Altough Tommy's own family was hardly ever at home, he found a new family."

After a while, Tim and his dog went to bed and imediately fell asleep. The frog knew that he was able to get free again and jumped out of the jar. Whenever the little boy woke up, he realized that the frog was gone. He felt bad for the frog and, together with his dog, he went to the woods to look after the frog. They called him, but of course, the frog did not answer the two. Tim had an idea and started to search in every little hole he could find: while he climbed onto an old tree to see if the frog was hiding up there, the dog started to see if the frog hid in an bee's home, but the frog could not be found anywhere. From the tree, Tim saw a big stone in the woods, on that he climbed to have a better overview over the area. While he sat on it and screamed for the frog , a deer appeared and took Tim on his head. He walked a few metres and threw him and his dog into a pond. Tim was really mad at the deer and in addition to that he was all wet, but did not give up searching. Suddenly, the two heard a sound behind an old branch of wood and got interested. They looked behind it and found the frog and his family sitting together happily. Tim had no idea that the only thing the frog wanted, was to be with his family and did not realize that the frog might be unhappy being alone in a jar. Tim took one of the frogs into his hands and thought about the pleasure he had watching the frog in his jar the day before. Finally, Tim and his dog were happy about their finding and took the frog home again.

One day Jackson and Chester went for a walk in the woods and they found a frog that seemed to be a little lonely. Jackson immediately fell in love with this little frog and decided to take him home. He named him Froggy. When Jackson came home he went straight into the kitchen , took a huge glas out of the cupboard and decided that this should be the place for Froggy to feel at home. Back in his room Jackson starred with such admiration at Froggy as if he had found a new best friend. And even his dog Chester got along with Froggy. But late at night when Jackson and Chester were asleep, Froggy climbed out of his new home and jumped right out of the window. The next morning when Jackson and Chester woke up they were really shocked to find no Froggy in their room. Jackson was really sad and missed Froggy so badly that he went out to search for Froggy in the woods. Of course, Chester was beside him, like always. When they finally arrived in the woods they called his name out loud. ""Froggy , Froggy !!! Where are you?"" . And even Chester helped Jackson to look for him. But Froggy was nowhere to find. When Jackson decided to climb onto a huge rock to get a better overview he must have overseen the deer that was behind it. He accidently held on to the deer, because he thought that it was a tree. That is when the deer got nervous and moved, which caused Jackson , and Chester who was behind him , to fall right over it and directly into the sea . Luckily they both know how to swim so they didn't panic. When they came out of the water they held on to a big fallen tree and felt safe rightaway. After they stood up and realised what just had happend and how unlucky they were they discovered Froggy . He sat behind the tree with his family. Froggy-wife and Froggy-children. This was the moment when Jackson realised what he had done and that he never thought about the fact that Froggy might have a family when he took him home. So he decided to go home with Chester and leave Froggy be alone with his family. He waved Froggy and his family goodbye and went for a walk with his old buddy Chester.Although he really misses Froggy he knew that it was for the best.

Unsurprisingly, they were very worried about the little frog. As a result, they both started looking for the frog in the forest. They shouted his name at the top of their lungs and looked in every place they could think of. Doing so, the little boy climbed on a rock and held on to what appeared to be a stick of a tree, not paying attention to whom this stick really belonged - a deer. The deer picked the little boy up and then threw him and his dog down a cliff. However, this cliff was not very high and both landed unharmed in a lake. Being in the lake, they heard a noise which sounded very familiar - it reminded them of their pet frog. Following the direction of the noise, the little boy and the do looked behind a huge dead tree. To their suprise, they found their frog surrounded by a couple of other frogs. Realizing that their friend would be happier around his family, the little boy and the dog left the frog in the forest.

They took it home and named it Higgins. It was already late in the night, but Timmy and Pyp just could not go to bed, due to their excitement about their new found friend. At one point, however, they could not help themselves but become tired and eventually go to bed, to dream about what they would all do together come morning. <br/>  As soon as the sun was up, Timmy and Pyp woke up, but when they checked upon Higgins, they were terribly shocked to see that he had disappeared in the middle of the night. So they braced themselves for another adventure and went out into the woods, trying to find Higgins.  <br/>  They called his name and searched everywhere.They climbed on trees and rocks. Suddenly, a big reindeer appeared out of the blue, took Timmy on its horns and threw him and Pyp over a tiny cliff into a pond. They were all soaking wet, but no matter how much reason they had to be upset about this unexpected encounter, they turned out thankful. When they looked behind big fallen tree trunk, they finally found Higgins. <br/>  But this was not the end of the story: They realised that Higgins had a wife and many little children and felt horribly sorry for having taken him away from his loved ones the other day. So they apologised, and happily said goodbye to Higgins and his family, promising to pay them a visit on their next adventure.

When Jimmy climed a huge rock to look behind a giant bush, the bush somehow became alive and moved. It appeared to be a deer, that hid behind it. It pushed both, Jimmy and his dog, down an embankment, right into a little lake. They got out of it, completely wet. Then, right behind a fallen tree, they finally found the frog.

At some point they had encountered a frog and managed to capture him in a large jar. Now it was getting dark and Mark sat in his room, contemplating the frog with curiosity. Soon he became tired and went to sleep. However, when he woke up the next morning, the jar was empty. Left unguarded, the frog had managed to escape at night. Mark was sad that the frog had abandoned him, since he only wanted to become friends with him. So, in order to find his friend, Mark and the dog went back out into the fields and started calling out to the frog. They looked in the fields, and in the forest. Finally, and near desperation, Mark climbed onto a huge rock and once more shouted for the frog. He did not receive an answer, but suddenly a deer broke through the trees and pushed both Mark and the dog off a cliff. Screaming, they fell into a pond, wwhich they had overseen before. As both were good swimmers they managed to climb out of the water without difficulties. While they were catching their breath, Mark suddenly caught sight of the very frog they had been looking for all the way. And he wasn't alone: Mark realised that the frog he had captured so selflessly had, in fact, a family. When he realised this, Mark decided it was better to leave the frogs in the forest, where they belonged. He waved goodbye and, along with the dog, started the journey back home.

While they were sleeping the frog escaped from the jar and jumped off. When the two little friends woke up in the morning the frog was gone and they were shocked and really sad. Straight away they went out to search for it. They went into the fields and the forest, shouted its name and hoped for it to return. They wanted their new friend back and were scared something might have happened to him. They even climbed trees and searched in every possible spot. When the boy climbed a rock, suddenly, a deer appeared and threw him into a pond next to the rock the boy had climbed. The dog landed next to the boy in the pond. Completely soaked they managed to climb out of it, holding on to a tree that had fallen down. When they took a breath on that tree stem they noticed something: There it was, the frog they had been searching for for the whole time. It was there with its wife and a few kids. It rushed to their minds how silly they were not having searched for it by the pond.

Apparently the boy forgot to put the lit of the jar back on and so the frog can climb out. The next morning the little boy finds that his frog had escaped over night. Eager to get his new pet back, he and is puppy venture out into the nearby fields to recover him. After a short while they find themselves at the edge of a wood. There the puppy and the boy keep looking for the frog, yet all the puppy can find is a wasp nest, while the boy unsucessfully looks into an empty tree stomp. In search of the frog they continue their journey deepter into the wood. The pupp keeps snuffing around, the boy keeps calling for the frog. While climbing a rock the boy tumbles over a stag that pushes the boy and his puppy down a little cliff into the pond below. After craling out of the muddy water the boy and his puppy continue looking for the frog around the pond.

While he himself was very happy about his new pet - a friend for his dog Butcher, mayhaps -, the frog did not share this happiness and escaped in the middle of the night. When waking up, Timmy was shocked to find out that the frog was gone, so he decided to go and look for him outside. He and Butcher spent almost the whole day wandering in the forest, climbing up trees and rocks, shouting (and barking) all the way. But the frog was nowhere to be found. Instead Timmy stumbled over a deer with majestic horns when he climbed up a pretty stone. The deer, not happy with a little, stupid boy on his head, got angry and threw Timmy and Butcher into a lake. Both boy and dog were soaking wet when they came out of the water. Exhausted, Timmy lay down flat on his belly over a tree trunk - and, miracles happen, this is were he found the escaped prisoner. The frog, he now learned, had a family. Upon realizing what this meant, Timmy decided to leave the frog in the depths of the forest and made his way home. Fortunately, he did not get in trouble with the deer again.

After an exciting day in the forest, Tim and his dog Struppi sat at the end of the bed in Tim's room and inspected their earlier find: a little frog, who was now sitting, not moving, in the glass jar Tim had put him into. As that got boring pretty quickly, Tim and Struppi decided to call it a night and go to bed. What they did not expect was, that the frog had just waited for this to happened and regained his strength and climbed out of the jar. When Tim and Struppi saw the empty jar in the morning, they could not believe it and decided to go search for their friend in the forest, where they had foud the frog the day before. <br/>  They searched everywhere, Tim climbed every tree in the area to get a better view and Struppi got himself into trouble with a bee hive, when trying to find the frog around it. Tim also climbed rocks, which his mum had always told him not to, since they can be pretty slippery, but that was not the problem... He held onto what he thought was a branch of a bush, but suddenly this branch started moving and he got picked up by a deer that had rested behind the rock. It gave Tim a good push and he fell down a little cliff, accompanied by his true friend Struppi.  <br/>  Both landed in the little pond below and got a big fright. They draged themselves out of the water and on to a dead tree stem, where they let out many coughs and took a couple of deep breath, before they were able to climb on top of the stem and look around. They could not believe what they saw: it was the frog family they found the day before and one of the frogs jumped towards Tim and Struppi straight away. That must be their friend, they thought, and since both sides seemed equally happy to be reunited, the rest of the frog family did not mind their fellow leaving with his friends. <br/>  Tim carried the frog on his hand, since he did not bring he jar, and with his other hand he waved good bye to the rest of the frog family.

He loved animals, he loved watching them and playing with them and he loved to keep them all to himself. His oldest companion, a dog named Woof, followed him everywhere he could and helped his master to sniff out new animals. <br/>  One day the boy and his dog found a little frog, took him carelessly with them and forced the poor thing into a glass-jar to be oggled at. In the night, as the boy and his dog were sleeping, the poor frog made a desperate attempt to flee. He used his long legs to move the lid of the glass jar and escaped promptly. <br/>  When the boy woke up the next morning he was astonished to find that his prisoner had escaped. Together with his dog he began to search for desperately, not willing to grant the frog its freedom. He searched far and wide, when he couldn't find him close, he went to the edge of the forest, when he could not find him there, he made his way into the forest. He looked into treetrunks, getting more and more frustrated as he couldn't find the little frog. The dog too looked feverously for it, but couldn't find it either. The boy grew angry and went as far as to climb on a small boulder, hoping to get a better view. He shouted and raged so loud, that even his loyal companion Woof ducked closer to the ground. <br/>  But the boy made a mistake there. A young stag, having heard the raging child and knowing about his callous nature, attacked the boy and tried to attack him to make him leave the forest. The boy and his dog startled and fell into a small pond. As they made their way out of the water and climbed over a fallen treetrunk, they say the frog family desperatly hiding behind it. <br/>  Smiling to himself he reached for the little frog, took him into his hands and waved mockingly at the little frog's upset family, which would never see their son and brother again. <br/>  And so the selfish little boy would continue to steal wild animals from their family and home for his amusement, never truly knowing the pain he caused.

He was so proud and happy to have a new animal friend besides his doggy. ,The boy was sleeping in his bed and didn't notice that the frog was escaping from his little glass prison.As soon as he woke up , he looked at the jar to check up on his little friend but to his surprise the jar was empty. Where was his froggy? Together with his dog he tried to figure out where he could have gone but all this thinking and not doing anything about it killed the boy. So he set off on the quest to find the little frog with his dog , because two eyes and a dog nose should be able to find the wild frog. They look all over the forest where he found the frog when he first caught it. He climbed trees and stones and yelled for his lost friend at the top of his lungs.While he was standing on a particularly big stone, he leaned over to hold onto what appeared to be branches from a tree but those branch suddenly began to move and picked him up. It was a deer with his giant antlers who carried him to a cliff and threw him off the edge. The poor boy fell into a river where he struggled not to drown. Luckily, he managed to pull him self onto a log that was close. He sat on the log for a while to rest when he spotted a frog family and imagine that -one of the bunch was his little lost froggy friend! The boy,his doggy and the frog are happy to be reunited and lived happily ever after.

When Timmy and Speedo discovered the empty jar in the morning they went on an adventure in the woods to find the frog. They walked over meadows and crawled up each rock searching for the frog. Timmy had crawled up a rock to call for the frog, when suddenly the branches in front of him moved. It was the antlers of a huge stag! The stag picked up Timmy with his antlers and threw him into a pond. Spido fell in along with Timmy trying to catch him. They landed in the pond. Thankfully, it was not al that deep of a pond so they swam to the shore and climbed up an old tree trunk to get out. When they climbed up the tree trunk, Imagine what they saw? It was the frog, surrounded by his little frog family. Timmy realised, that the frog would be much happier living with his family, so he left him by the pond. Timmy and Spido waved the frogs goodbye and went home to think of new animals to rip from their families and take hostage, the little psychopath. And they lived happily ever after... except for the animals, that got abducted that is.

Before going to bed, they take a last look at it, say goodnight and fall asleep. When they wake up the next morning, they find the jar empty. The frog has ecaped. Tim is worried and looks at Rex, who doesn't know where the frog has gone either. They get up and go outside to look for him. <br/>  They go deep into the woods, looking everywhere for the frog. They look inside tree trunks and up on hills but the frog is nowhere to be found. Tim calls for him as well, but unsurprisingly, does not get an answer. When standing on a hill, Tim and Rex get pushed inside a lake by a deer. They crawl on solid gound and lay on a tree trunk to rest. And who do they discover? Their frog friend alongside what seems to be his family. Tim realises that he should not have taken the frog away in the first place, since he does not belong in the house of a human being and has his own home. Rex and Tim take one last look at the family, they wave goodbye and go back home. Glad to have made a good friend who is safe and sound in his natural environment.
