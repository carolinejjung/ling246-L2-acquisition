He looks up to the window from where the trash was thrown out and picks the baby up.  <br/>  <br/> Right behind him arrives a woman with a Buggy. She seems to look for something.Chaplin tries to get her attention, while she is returning from entering a house entrance he sets the baby into the buggy to the other kid. The woman is furious and tells him after Chaplin wants to leave her with both kids in the buggy to take the kid back and he eventually does that and walks away. <br/>  <br/> Chaplin arrives at the spot where he found the baby and put it back while a policeman arrived behind him seriously scanning the Situation. Chaplin turning around and almost stumbling into the policeman returns to the baby, picks it up and walks around the corner and finds an elderly man with a walking stick. Chaplin puts the baby in his arms and fastly walks away after pretending he needs to tie up his shoe. <br/>  <br/> The elderly man quickly walks with the baby around the corner just to find a buggy with another kid inside where he places the baby and disappears. After he is gone the woman from before steps out of the entrance and looks at the buggy, gets annoyed and is likely to look for Charlie Chaplin who encounters again the police man and eventually passes without any reaction. She follows him, hits him with her umbrella and drags him back to the buggy. They argue about the baby when the policeman joints the situation. Finally, Chaplin takes the baby out of the buggy and walks away, so do the others.  <br/>  <br/> Chaplin sits on the sidewalk thinking about putting the baby into a duct but then he rolls back.  <br/> He looks at the baby and finds a note saying that this baby is an orphan and needs love and care.  <br/> He smiles at the baby in his arms, gets up and walks away with it.

Since his attempts of leaving the baby in another woman's stroller remain unsuccessful and the idea of giving the baby to strangers turns out the same way, he gets used to keeping the baby. As he finds a note in the baby's clothes which bid the person finding the child to love it and care for it, it seems like Chaplin decides to do so.

When he passes the houses he is always hit by objects that somebody throws out of the window. After a while he reaches a place of dustbins where there is no risk of falling items anymore. When he calmly smokes a cigarette he notices a bundle of clothes behind one of the containers. Charlie Chaplin soon finds out that there is a baby inside the bundle. At first, he assumes the baby fell out of a window, then he sees a mother with a child in a pushchair and thinks that this woman could have dropped the other baby. However, he tries to get the woman's attention in vain. That's why Charlie Chaplin simply puts the baby into the lady's pushchair. When the woman finds out that there is another baby in her child's pushchair she becomes very angry and insistes Charlie Chaplin to fetch back the baby. When Charlie Chaplin decides to put the baby back where he had found it he is caught by a policeman. In his next attempt to get rid of the baby Charlie Chaplin tries to give the little child to a man, who carries a walking stick. <br/> The man does not want to be responsible for the baby and puts it again into the woman's pushchair. When the lady discovers that the strange baby is back in her child's pushchair she is very furious, chases Charlie Chaplin, hits him with her umbrella and forces him to fetch back the baby. Eventually, Charlie Chaplin feels so overwhelmed with his duty to care for the child that he considers to throw it into gully. When he discovers a note into the baby's bundle that begs the finder to lovingly care for this orphan Charlie Chaplin changes his opinion and decides to look after the child."

Since he doesn't know what to do with the child, he tries to get rid of the kid, first by putting it into a somebody else's pram, maybe assuming that the child belongs to this woman, who, however, chases them away angrily. When Charlie wants to put the child back to where he found it, a police officer watches him, thinking that Charlie wants to abandon the child. After that Charlie takes off, together with the kid. He meets a passer-by, slipping the child into the passer-by's hand, before taking off again. The man who's got the child now unknowingly puts it into the same pram as Charlie did before. When the woman realizes that the unknown child is back again in her pram, she immediately thinks of Charlie who passes the street at that very moment. After getting beaten up by that lady and while argueing the police officer walks over and Charlie sees himself forced to take the child with him one more time. Then, he sits down on the roadside. When he notices a drain right next to him, he considers to throw the kid into it for a second but he decides not to do it. Shortly after, he finds a note in the child's cloth, saying that this child is an orphan that needs to be taken care of and that needs to be loved.

He stops and opens a little box that seems to contain half-smocked cigares and cigarettes. In the following, the man uses a match to lighten a cigar, before starting to smoke it. All of his gestures are exaggerated, which adds to the all in all comedic feeling of the video.  <br/> Suddenly, he turns around and finds an infant, who is swaddled in a blanket beneath a trashcan. The man picks the baby up and looks around and up into the sky, seemingly wondering where the baby came from. He sees a woman with a baby in a stroller passing by and places the found infant in her stroller, telling her that she has dropped something. Meanwhile, the woman, starts shouting  and arguing. Devastated, the man takes the baby out of the stroller and the now angry woman walks of with her child. <br/> In the next scene, the man tries to lay the baby down next to the trashcan, where he has found it earlier, when a police officer passes by and sees it. Probably thinking the man just tries to get rid of his baby, he scolds him. The man leaves quickly with the baby.  <br/> In the following scene the man finds an old man, walking slowly with the help of a walking cane. He gestures at the eldery man to hold the baby, while he acts as if he is tying his shoe laces, before quickly running off.  <br/> The man, followed by the eldery man,  runs away and finally hides in a big container. The eldery man cannot find him and is left with the baby, until he sees another baby in a stroller in front of a store. He quickly drops of the baby and walks away. In this moment, the police officer is passing by.  <br/> When a woman exits the store it is visible that it is the same woman that appeared earlier in the clip. She sees the young man passing by and starts attacking him, thinking that he placed the baby into her stroller again.  <br/> The police officer notices the argument and stops by. After the women explained the situation the young man quickly picks up the baby again.  <br/>  <br/> Finally, he sits down with the baby in his arms. Underneath him, there is an utility hole. He debates throwing the baby away, when suddenly he finds a note in the baby's swaddle. The note says ""Please love and care for this orphan child"".  <br/>  <br/> In the last scene the man looks at the baby and stands up, finally accepting his fate."

While doing so a woman throws her trash out of the window and almost hits him. A few seconds and meters later, an unknown persons who we do not see, does the same and hits him. Charlie is obviously angry and lights a cigarette. Just seconds after that he finds a baby, covered in sheets laying on the ground. He wonders if it was also just thrown out of the window or to whom it belongs. As a woman with a baby carriage passes by he chases her and wants to put it back in there because he believes that she lost one of hers. The woman gets furious as it turns out not to be her child and he walks away with the orphan. Charlie seems to be unable to cope with the situation and tries to get rid of the baby. But as he puts it back to the place where he found it, a policeman catches him and he instantly picks it back up. Still trying to get rid of the baby, he gives it to an old man who can barely walk and runs away. But the old man comes up with the same idea as Charlie did, he puts the baby inside the buggy of the woman. Unfortunately she realizes that the orphan was put in her baby carriage the moment Charlie walks past. She chases him down, beats him up and makes him take the baby. He has no other choice than to do so because the policeman appears again. Frustrated by the situation, Charlie sits down on the curb and even thinks of throwing the orphan in the drain. A few moments later, after finding a letter which says ""please love and care for this orphan child"", his mood suddenly lights up and he feels responsible. At the end he walks away with the baby and disappears in a small side street."

After ligthing up a cigar he spots a baby on the ground. He picks it up just when a mother with a pram passes by and appears to be looking for something. Chaplin, in good intent, thinks the kid belongs to her and puts it into the pram, only to find out that the baby is not affiliated with the woman. He then picks it up once again but soon finds himself wanting to leave the baby behind. In order to to that he hands the baby a passer who, in turn, seeks to get rid of the unwanted ""gift"". He then, just like Chaplin, discovers the pram of the woman, to drop the kid off and walk away quickly. As Chaplin walks by the woman by accident, she beats him up and insits on him taking the baby with him. At the end Chaplin finds a note attached to the kid's clothes that asks for the finder to provide love and a good home for the baby which is an orphan."

Looking to the side, he sees a baby laying next to one of the barrels. He advances towards the small human being and lifts it up. In the very same moment a woman walks by pushing a child's pushchair in front of her. He runs after her, however, before being able to reach her, the woman enters the building in the alley from which the items where thrown. Carles Chaplin then puts the baby into the pushchair. Meanwhile, the woman exits the house and observes Chaplin's action. Angrily, she approaches him, and the only thing that the recipient can see is a black screen with the words: ""Pardon me, you've dropped something"". The woman steams up and furiously says something that cannot be heard. Chaplin then almost takes the wrong baby out of the pushchair. However, he is reminded by the woman that he took the wrong human being. He puts it back, takes the baby that he found next to the barrels and walks away. The barrels is the place where he goes to next, to return the baby. A police man appears, stops with a stern look on his face and Charles Chaplin takes the small creature back into his arms and followingly he is seen in a different street. Here, another man with a walking aid can be perceived. Chaplin puts the baby into the man's arms and runs away. Carrying th baby, the man follows him. However, Chaplin manages to hide in a shed.

The woman is again forcing the man (who picked up the baby in the first place) to take it back, as he is just accidentally passing by again.

He then lits himself a cigarette only to find a baby lying next to the trashcan. The man checks if there is anyone around whom the baby maybe belong to but hes not able to spot anyone until a woman with a baggy comes down the alley. With her having still space left in the baggy, the man assumes that the baby might belong to her and puts it in the baggy. The woman then refuses to take the baby, probably claiming its not her own.   While the man tries to bring the baby back to the place he found it, a police officer walks by and spots him  so the man stops his doing and continues walking. When he sees a man walking with a sick, he ask if he could hold the baby for him so he can tie his shoes. Being freed he rans off and leaves the baby and hides in the alley. The man with the stick tries to find him but instead discovers the abandoned baggy and places the baby inside. Meanwhile the man has to leave his cover because the police office is walking in his direction. He passes the baggy just when the Woman returns to her babby and notices the second baby. The woman rans after him and hits him with an Umbrella, and gets him to go back to the baggy but the man refuses to take the baby. But the woman sees the police officer walking down the streets and tries to make notice of the argument going on between her and the man. The man immediately picks up the baby and leaves the scene. He then sits down on the curb thinking about pushing the baby down the gutter but he doesnt. He spots a note claiming that the person who finds the baby hopefully loves and takes care for the baby.After a while he walks down the same alleyway he came from  still holding the baby.

Chaplin	written_online	20	Outside classroom	Spellchecker	In the movie clip Charles Chaplin is on a stroll when he finds a crying baby lying on the floor of a lonely alleyway. Chaplin is confused and when in that very same moment a mother pushing a stroller passes him, he connects the dots and assumes that she dropped the baby. The woman is indignant and tells Chaplin to take the baby back when he puts it into the stroller with her own baby. He goes to put the baby back in the spot where he found it but a police officer catches him in the act. Chaplin flees the scene with the baby in his arms and catches a man walking when he turns the corner. He hands the baby over to him under the pretence of tying his shoes but then he promptly runs away, leaving the baby behind. In his quest to get rid of the baby, the man finds the stroller from Chaplin's previous encounter and puts the baby inside while the mother is nowhere to be found. In a fate of bad luck, Chaplin passes that very same stroller and the mother, who has now returned, assumes that Chaplin put the baby back inside. She drags him to the stroller and makes him take the baby back again with the help of the police officer. Chaplin, who considers throwing the baby into the sewer for a short moment, sits down and finds a letter between the cloth the baby is wrapped up in. The note begs the reader to “love and care for this orphan child”. Chaplin seems to be touched by this and the music transitions into a happier melody when he finally smiles at the baby. The video ends with Chaplin leaving the scene with the baby in his arms.

The first person he met was a nanny of another Baby, who he thought, could be the nanny of the Baby he found too. She denied it in a not very friendly manner and forced him to take the Baby back. He then tried to lay the Baby back in the streets but while doing so he was interupted by a police officer. Shortly after he met an old man, who he kindly asked to hold the Baby for a minute, and ran off. Unfortunetaly the old man passed the Lady with the other Baby again and put the Baby in her stroller. She then recognized Charlie in the streets shortly after and, joined by the same police officer, who entered the scenery due to coincidence, Charlie had no choice but to take the Baby back. The film comes to a close when Charlie found a letter with the Baby saying that somebody please love the orphan child. The final scene of the film shows Charlie adopting the baby eventually."

It deals with the issue of responsibility. The protagonist Charlie suddenly finds a baby in an absent corner beside some bins. He takes the baby and tries to hand it to several other people which he meets on the streets. As he does not know to whom the baby belongs, he hands it to several other passer-bys. For instance, Charlie tries to put the baby into a baby buggy of a woman, who reacts impulsive and aggressive. She hands the baby straight back to him. To conclude, he does not know where to take the baby, for all his tries to get rid of the newborn failed. Therefore he sits down with it and finds a small letter. In this letter it is written that the writer of it could not take care of the baby and hopes that somebody would take care instead. By this, the short clip ended."

After that he decides to take out a cigar and shortly after that he notices a baby just lying on the ground, which he decides to pick up. Making a logic conclusion he puts the baby in a baby buggy of some unknown mother, thinking it is her missing child because the buggy is build for two babies. It turns out the woman is not the mother of the child and angrily returns it to Chaplin. Without any options left he puts the baby back to the place he found it, but is forces to take it back because a policeman spotted him doing so. Chaplin, not wanting to take care of a random baby he found, simply hands it over to some old man on the street and runs away. The old man is not able to find Chaplin, and by pure coincidence puts the child in the same buggy Chaplin tried earlier. The policemans presence forces Chaplin to take the same way the old man did making him walk past by the buggy. The woman notices him and beats him up with her umbrella. Unwillingly taking back the baby he is unsure what to do with it but after finding a note of the mother inside the blankets the baby is covered in, he decides to take care of the child.

He is wearing a suit and a hat, carrying a walking stick. The second time a person dropped rubbish on Chaplin trough the window, he was angry and started coursing at this person saying: 'Awkward ass'. After this he lit up his cigarette and walked on. Suddenly, he found a crying baby so he picked it up and put it into the pram of a woman that just walked by saying to her: 'Pardon me, you dropped something.', which shows that he is being polite and slightly rude at the same time as he is assuming that the baby belongs to the woman. The woman complained so Chaplin took the baby again and put it back to where he found it. What he didn't realize was that he has been watched by a policeman so Chaplin had to take the baby into his arms again. When another man, who was older than Chaplin, passed by, Chaplin gave him the baby and ran away. This man put the baby back into the woman's pram which stood outside a store. When the woman came out of the store and discovered the second baby in her pram she was annoyed and started to get angry. Chaplin walked by her and she couldn't help herself but attacking him as well as showing him why she did so. The policeman walked by and the woman complained to him about Chaplin who ended up carrying the baby with him again. Sitting down in the edge of the sidewalk beside a drain, he was thinking about dropping the baby there but hesitated as it was most likely to be the child's death sentence. Then he found a letter in between the child's clothes, which he began to read. It said: 'Please love and care for this orphan child'. Chaplin put the piece of paper into his chestpocket and looked at the baby. In the end, he got up and walked away with the baby carried safely in his arms.

Suddenly bricks fell down on him from above, which turned his cigarette off. While lighting up a new cigarette, he discovers a baby beside a garbage can. He assumes that the baby belongs to a woman with a stroller, who walkes by in that moment. Consequently, he puts the baby inside the stroller but the woman gets angry and forces him to take the baby back. Afterwards, he tries to lay the baby back down beside the garbage can but a police officer happens to overlook the scene, forcing him to take the baby back into his arms. After noticing an elderly man walking by, he forcefully makes the man take the baby and walks away. The man coincidentelly discovers the same woman with the stroller from before and puts the baby into the stroller without the woman noticing. When Chaplin walks by again, the woman sees the baby in the stroller and angrily forces him to take the baby again under the watchfull eyes of the police officer. After shortly thinking about puting the baby into the drain channel, Chaplin gives up and discovers a letter inside the blanket in which the baby is wrapped up which notifies him that the baby is an orphan. Shortly after reading that Chaplin happily decides to keep the baby.

A few moments later he finds a little baby, wrapped in blankets laying on the ground in a little corner. Chaplin looks up to the balcony which causes for comedic effect. He seems to think that someone had thrown out their child, just like they are throwing out trash out of the balcony. He immediatly takes the baby and tries to find it's mother or father. He tries to find someone he can give the baby to. After seeing a woman with a stroller, he assumes that the baby belongs to the woman eventhough there was already a baby in the stroller. He carefully places the child in the stroller and tries to get out of the situation as politely as possible. He even says: ''you dropped something'' and is tipping his head, like he has done something admirable. But the woman is not accepting that child and gives the baby back to Chaplin. His second idea is to simply place the baby back to where he found it. On the street, right next to a trash can. This plan is quickly interrupted by the police officer passing by. He is not asking why Chaplin is trying to put the baby there, he simply gives him a look and Chaplin takes the baby and goes away. His third plan is to give the baby to a man he sees on the street. He told the man that he has to tie his shoe and as soon as the man takes the child, Chaplin runs away. The man, holding the baby in his arms sees the woman with the stroller and, like Chaplin just places the baby in the stroller and runs away. Chaplin is passing by that woman a moment later and she immediatly recognizes him and is furious. She even smacks him on his head and gives him back the baby. In that moment, the tramp was visibly desperate. He did not know what to do with the baby so he just sat on the sidewalk. Unwrapping the child a little bit, he discovers a note that says ''love this orphan child''. After that he gives the baby a little hug, gets up and goes his own way. He is not looking for anyone he can give the baby anymore. He is taking it with him.

He picks up the baby, wanting to go looking for its parent, when a woman with a baby stroller comes walking by. Chaplin catches up to the stroller, but the woman has temporarily left. He places the baby inside, when suddenly the woman emerges again, claiming it is not her baby and he should take it back. The woman walks away and Chaplin returns to the point where he originally found the small child. He places the baby back on the ground, when a police man appears behind him, observing this. Immediately, Chaplin takes the baby and walks off. He comes upon an old man, with a walking stick. Under the pretense that Chaplin has to tie his shoelaces, he gives the man the baby. Instead of taking it back, Chaplin runs away. He hides from the old man. The old man comes looking for him and finds a baby stroller. Here he puts the baby and walks away. Chaplin emerges from his hideout. He walks by the baby stroller and is spotted by the woman, who, upon realizing the baby is once again in her stroller, proceeds to beat Chaplin with her umbrella. The police man notices the two arguing and approaches. Chaplin once again decides to pick up the baby. He walks away and sits down on the side of the road. For a split second, he considers dropping the baby down the drain, but does not. He finds a bit of paper underneath the child's clothes. It reads ""Please love and care for this orphan child."" Chaplin's attitude changes, and with joy in his step, he walks off, together with the baby in his arms."

As someone throws his trash right where he is standing, he pauses, lights a cigarette and recognize a baby to his left lying on the ground. Meanwhile a woman with a stroller walks by and Chaplin assumes that the baby belongs to her. He lays it down in the stroller but when the woman sees him she gets angry and tells him to take the baby back. He then takes the child again and wants to put it back to where he found it, but because a policeman is watching him he leaves with the baby in his arms. After that he walks by an old man and ask him to hold the baby as he wants to tie up his shoe. But he is just pretending and leaves without the baby. The old man then walks through the streets, looking for a way to get rid of the baby. He sees a stroller, put the baby in it and leaves as well. The stroller is the one belonging to the woman Chaplin met before. When she gets out of the store she gets upset because the baby is back with her. At the same time, Charlie Chaplin walks by and she then assumes that he is responsible for it again and hits him with an umbrella. The police man joins the situation and Chaplin better leaves with the baby because the woman accuses him. Without knowing what to do he sits down on the curb. While he is looking at the baby he finds a piece of paper that states that someone should please love and take care of the orphan. Touched by this he stands up and leaves, holding the baby in his arms.

She realizes his action and hands him back the baby. Subsequently Chaplin puts back the baby where he found it but is observed by a police officer. Realizing he cannot leave the baby there he takes it and walks the streets carrying it in his arms. He then asks a man to hold the baby for a minute so he can tie his shoe. After the man took the child from him, Chaplin runs away and hides. The man tries to find him but fails. Thus, he places the baby in the buggy of the same lady Chaplin placed it in before. The lady discovers the child at the exact same moment Chaplin, who came out of his hideout, walks by. She recognizes him and hits him with her umbrella and makes him pick up the baby with help of the police officer. Chaplin then sits down on the curb and thinks about throwing the baby in the drain. However, he decides not to and discovers a letter hidden under the baby's blanket. The letter says that the child is an orphan and its finder should love the child and take care of it. After reading the letter, he smiles and takes the child with him.

Charles has to move out of the way to not get hit. He continues walking while he's havin a smoke. He then gets hit by somebody else throwing out bricks. He dusts himself off and lights another cigarette. Afterwards he finds a baby laying on the floor which he wants to give to a woman who is strolling by with a trolley but it appears that it's not her kid. Charles takes the kid and wants to put it back where he found it. But a police officer walks by and gives him a warning look. Charles then picks the baby back up and continues walking. He passes an older gentleman, puts the baby in his arms and runs away to hide. The old man sees the trolley and puts the baby into it without the woman noticing and walks off. Next thing you see is Charles coming out of his hiding place. He walks past the woman who sees the baby back in her trolley and follows Charles and calls the police officer. Charles then takes the baby and continues his journey. He sits down and seems to think. He then finds a note in the baby's pocket which reads: Please love and care for this orphan child. He smiles at the baby and walks off the scene with the kid in his arms.

After a few metres, he gets hit by bricks which seem to have been thrown down at him from someone in the house on the side of the street. Charlie Chaplin looks confused and tries to figure out who threw them at him. He then grabs a box with cigarettes and lights one with his show. While smoking, he takes closer looks at the surroundings and notices a baby on the ground, laying beside a garbage bin. Slowly, he approaches the bunch and looks at it, before taking it up and holding it in front of his face for closer inspection. He then searches for an opportunity to get rid of the baby and sees a woman with pram, which he then follows in order to lay down the baby in a moment when the woman does not pay attention to him. Unfortunately for him, she sees him and screams at him to take the child away. After that, Charlie Chaplin returns to the garbage bin and puts the baby back on the ground, when a police man appears behind him, urging him to take the baby back in his arms. Charlie Chaplin walks away and takes one last chance to get rid of the child when he gives it away to a beggar, before running away. The beggar looks confused, tries to follow him but can not manage to catch up. Instead, he passes the lady with the pram again, who again is not paying attention. The beggar puts the baby down in the pram, just like Charlie Chaplin did before, then walks away. At the same time when the lady enters the street again and discovers the second baby in the pram, Charlie Chaplin passes her. She confrontates him violently. At the end, Charlie Chaplin accepts the kid on his arm, sits down with it and reads a note that had been written for the person who finds it. ""Please love and care for this orphan child"", it says. Charlie Chaplin smiles, and walks away with the kid in his arms."

He proceeds on his way smoking a cigarette when suddenly a pile of rubble falls down on him from above. Seemingly annoyed he looks for another cigarette as his previous one fell on the floor with the rubble. Before he starts to continue walking he spots a baby on the side of a building, he acts confused and it seems as he were looking for the child's parents. He then sees a woman walking by with a buggy. The woman leaves the buggy standing by the side of a building to go inside, Charles Chaplin uses the time to put the child he found in the buggy next to the woman's but she caught him in the act and asks him angrily to remove the second child from the buggy. He now looks for other ways to get rid of the child, at first, he tries to put it back where he found it but a policeman sees it, afterwards he hands it to another man he sees walking around. Said man now looks for a place for the child in Charles Chaplin's place, sees the woman's unattended buggy and places the child in it. Mr. Chaplin, now happy that he does no longer have to look after the child, walks past the building next to which the buggy still stands. The woman comes back to the buggy and sees the second, unwanted child. She wonders where it came from and sees Charles Chaplin. She runs after him and beats him up with her umbrella, forcing him to take back the child. Mr. Chaplin walks away with the child and sits down on the kerb. He sees a sewer next to him and thinks about dropping the child in it. He does not seem very convinced of this idea though, so he takes a closer look at the child. Doing that, he finds a letter saying, ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". The letter moves him and changes his attitude towards the child immediately, he starts to smile and walks away happily with the child in his arm."

He then puts the baby back where he found it just when a police officer walks by. Upon seeing the other man, Chaplin picks up the baby immediately and leaves. Walking around with the baby, he finds an old man whom he gives the baby under the impression of having to lace his shoes, when suddenly he runs away. The old man, certainly as unbothered by the small child, happens to run into the stroller of the woman as well, placing the baby into it then and walking away from the scene. Chaplin meanwhile unintentionally runs into the woman and the stroller again, who becomes mad at an instant and demands him to take out ""his"" baby. The police officer happens to stand close by. Realizing this, Chaplin takes the baby and leaves. In the next scene, Chaplin sits down, looking defeated, the child in his arms.

A police officer appears and watches him curiously. Chaplin has no other choice but to take the baby again in his arms and to walk around the corner. When he sees a man walking around, he attempts to hand the baby over to him and to escape. The man follows Chaplin angrily and puts it into the stroller of the mother and disappears quickly.

Learning that it is an orphan and needs someone to love and take care of it, he holds it close to him and decides that he will not abandon it.

An unseen person tosses trash out of the window, not minding the passersby underneath. When he eventually passes the window, he plays around with his walking stick before he is hit with more trash from another window. As it is a silent movie, the spoken text is shown in title cards, the first one says ""Awkward ass."" The man looks at the trash, the up towards the window and takes out a small box filled with cigars. To light one of them, he takes off his gloves and lights a match on the heel of his shoe. Then he throws his gloves away.  <br/> As he turns to the side, a baby is shown lying on the ground, seemingly abandoned. The man looks at the baby, then around as if he was searching for somebody responsible. When nobody is seen, he picks up the child. In the background, a woman appears from the left, pushing a stroller. The man attempts to get her attention and ends up following her to what seems to be her house. The stroller, which she left outside, is occupied by another child, older than the discovered baby, but the man wants to put the younger kid down nonetheless. When the woman re-appears, she is shocked, so the man tries to explain the situation by saying: ""Pardon me, you dropped something."" The woman does not seem to be happy about it and is shown yelling at the man, clearly indicating that this is not her child, so the man takes it with him once again. The woman storms off. <br/> Carrying the child back to the alley where he found it, the man wants to leave it there to be found by somebody else, but a police officers sees him doing it. When the man notices the officer, he promptly turns around once more, picks up the baby once more and leaves to the right side of the screen. <br/> A new alley is shown, with another man already walking along. The man walks up to him, stops, pretends that he has to tie his show laces and proceeds to hand him the child. He then runs off, leaving the baby to the stranger, but the new man follows. As the first man hides in a garage, the other one is looking for him, only to discover the stroller from before, still occupied by the other child. He puts the baby down, this time without the appearance of the mother. The man from the beginning, now child-less, dares to leave his hideout, only to run into the police man once more, so he quickly turns the other way. <br/> Meanwhile, the mother is shown, returning to her child where she finds the baby alongside it. However, as the man who actually placed it there has already left and the other man just happens to pass the stroller, she accuses him of leaving his child there. The accusation happens in the form of chasing him and hitting him with an umbrella, which causes the man to fall. She drags him back to the stroller, still hitting him as she does so. The police man comes out of an alley and notices the racket. The woman, still furious, explains the situation to him, which the man doesn't try to argue, so he only takes the baby and leaves the scene. As do the officer and the woman. <br/> In the next cut, the man standing on an empty sidewalk in front of a gutter. He sits down on the ground and opens said gutter. For a moment, he looks at the child, but then closes it again and only readjust his grip on the lump in his arms. for the first time, he looks at it more closely and discovers a small scrap of paper hidden in the folds of the blanket that is draped around the baby. ""Please love and care for this orphan child,"" is written on the paper. The man puts the paper away and looks at the baby again, smiling this time. In the last shot, he leaves to the end of the scenery."

Almost being hit by an object which appears to be a brick, that a lady has thrown out of a window located right above his head, he has to take a step to the side. He keeps on walking and only a few seconds later he actually does get hit by another item that has been thrown out of the window. It is not easy to tell what the aforementioned object is but it looks like a bundle of branches and leaves. A little text pops up saying 'awkward ass'. Chaplin looks up to the window and then takes a box of cigarettes and cigars out of his jacket's inside pocket. He eventually takes out a cigarette and lights it after having taken off his leather gloves. He discards the taken off gloves and he discovers a baby lying in the corner of the street, wrapped in a blanket, screaming. Chaplin looks up in confusion assuming that the baby has been dropped out of a window as well and he picks it up. With the baby in his arms he struts to a lady's pushchair, which already has one child in it, and he carefully puts the new found infant in it too. Another text pops up saying 'Pardon me! You dropped something'. The woman, who did not see Chaplin at first, now spots him and furiously starts an argument. As a consequence, Chaplin now takes back the child and attempts to put it back to the place where he found it in the first place. However, this was prevented by a policeman looking at him strictly. Chaplin gives him an apologising look and picks up the baby again. He marches around the corner with the baby in his hands and sees an old man with a walking stick. Chaplin asks the man to hold the baby so that he could tie his shoelaces. He bends down but when the man did not look, Chaplin hurries away with the old man following him. Having lost sight of Chaplin, the elderly man finds the pushchair and places the baby in it, just like Chaplin attempted to do it earlier in the video. Leaving his hiding place, Chaplin encounters the police officer again and changes his direction to not have to pass him. Now the woman sees the second baby lying in the pushchair again and looks around trying to find the person being guilty of this. Coincidentally Chaplin walks past the lady in this exact moment and the women, recognising Chaplin from the earlier incident, knocks him down with her umbrella. After a heated discussion between these two, the police officer joins them but he remains silent. Finally, Chaplin takes the baby again and sits down with it on the pavement. He thinks about throwing the baby into the sewers but then reconsiders. In the end he finds a note that has been attached to the baby's blanket saying 'please love and care for this orphan child'. Looking at the baby's complexion, he smiles and leaves taking the baby with him.

Near a dumpster, he finds and picks up a little baby. In the background of that scene, a woman is pushing a buggy. The man puts the parentless baby into that buggy which causes a discussion with the woman who wants the man to take the baby out of her buggy. He subsequently puts the baby back to the place where he found it, but this action was seen by a police officer, so that the man picks the baby back up again - only to giving it to an older man and instantly running away. The older man now puts the baby into the buggy of the aforementioned woman and runs away too. When she discovers the baby, the man that originally found the baby is walking past her. She runs after him, strikes him down from behind and calls him out until the police officer arrives. As a result, the man picks up the baby yet another time. He thinks about throwing it into a gully, but he decides not to. That is when he finds a slip of paper saying ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". After reading it, the man stands up from the curbstone and, with the little child in his hands, walks down a narrow road into the background until the video ends."

Unidentifiable materials are being thrown out of the windows of the houses on both sides of the alley causing Chaplinˋs mood to darken. As he comes to a stop lighting himself a cigarette, Chaplin sees a baby wrapped in blankets lying on the ground. He picks it up carefully and decides to place it in a baby carriage of a woman standing nearby. As he makes an attempt to do so, telling the woman that she dropped something, the woman gets angry. Chaplin picks the baby up reluctantly and puts it exactly in the same place he found it. A police officer approaching behind Chaplin causes him to pick the baby up once more. On his way through the alleys he gives the foundling to an old man quickly running away. By chance, the old man places the baby in the same baby carriage in which Chaplin had already put it. As the owner comes out of the shop before which the baby carriage had stood unobserved, she sees the baby. Chaplin who walks by that moment is persuaded by the woman and the approaching police officer to take the baby with him a last time. Defeated in his trys to hand over the baby to someone else Chaplin sits down on the sidewalk. A short moment he thinks about putting the baby into the drain. Followed by his decision not to do so, Chaplin finds a note hidden in the babyˋs blankets asking the finder to care for the orphan child. Chaplin walks away cradling the baby gently.

He puts the baby in her stroller while commenting that she must have lost it. She argues and threatens him, so he picks up the baby and leaves. He wants to put the child back to where he found it, but a police officer follows him, so Chaplin does not dare to leave the child there.

The moment Chaplin passes by the stroller, the woman comes out again and notices the second child. The police officer reappears, so the woman accuses Chaplin. He takes the child and sits down at the roadside. He finds a piece of paper attached to the child, that asks the person who finds the orphan child to take care of it.

Suddenly, after lighting a cigarette, Charlie finds a baby at the side of the road. After some confusion, he decides to put it in the pushchair of a women, assuming she 'dropped' the baby. But she didn't and makes him take it back. Charlie's next idea is to just put it back where he found it, but a policeman catches him in the act, which makes Charlie take it back into his arms and walk off. Fooling an old man, he then manages to leave the baby in said man's arms, hiding from him until he thinks it's safe to come out. The old man has the same idea as Charlie originally and drops the baby in the pushchair. Upon leaving his hiding spot, he encounters the policeman again This makes him change directions quickly. By chance, he walks past the women and her pushchair again, thus making her believe he dropped the baby in there and so she beats him with her umbrella. The policeman makes another appearance and Charlie is yet again forced to take back the baby. Dropping his cane on the sidewalk, he sits down on the curb to retrieve it. He is wondering for a moment whether he should drop the baby down the drain, but quickly decides against it. Instead, he finds a piece of paper with the words ""please love and care for this orphan child"" written on it. This seems to make him sentimental. He cuddles the child close to his chest and walks off."

From an around four meter high window someone throws out his trash which nearly hits Chaplin. After hesitating for just a second, Chaplin proceeds on his way until he is hit by trash from another window further down the alleyway which knocks a cigarette out of his mouth. The text ""Awkward ass"" appears on the screen, as Chaplin looks above him and shortly after he searches his cigarette case for a new one. Chaplin pulls one out, sticks it in his mouth and then pulls out a match which he lights on his shoe. After taking the first hit of his cigarette, Chaplin notices a newborn to his left next to whats looks like a trashcan of some sort. He then inspects it for a couple of seconds and takes a look around him before picking the newborn up. A lady with a stroller walks past him and he shouts after her, before laying the baby into the stroller. Another text pops up, saying: ""Pardon me, you dropped something"". Chaplin points at the baby as he walks away but the lady insists that the baby is not hers. After picking up the wrong child at first, Chaplin is corrected by the lady and picks up the baby he found earlier and leaves the now certainly angry lady. He returns the baby to the place he found it, not noticing the police officer standing behind him. Chaplin then turns around, notices the police officer and quickly picks the baby up again, walking around the corner where a man with visible physical problems walks down the street. The man is handed the baby by Chaplin under the excuse of tieing his shoelaces, before he quickly runs away. The old man tries to chase Chaplin, who quickly hid behind a corner. After a few seconds, the old man finds the same stroller Chaplin found before and lays the baby inside it. When coming out of his hiding place, Chaplin runs into the police officer and quickly turns around, running directly to the lady with the stroller. After ignoring her, she chases him and knocks him to the ground with an umbrella. She grabs him by his jacket and pulls him right back to her stroller, and after a few seconds of arguing over the baby the police officer joins them. Chaplin then picks the baby up again, drops his walking stick and sits down on the sidewalk. He then opens an manhole and thinks about dropping the baby inside it, but quickly comes to the decision not to do it. Shortly after, Chaplin finds a note in the sheets the baby is covered in, which says:""Please love and care for this orphan child"". Afterwards, he inspects and plays with the child for a brief moment, before standing up happily and taking the child with him."

Throughout the rest of the clip he tries to get rid of it by tricking other people into taking it. These include a woman, who already had a baby, and an old man. Each attempt to get rid of the baby fails, even leaving it in the place he found it, since an officer caught him doing so. The clip ends with Chaplin finding a piece of paper in the baby's blanket on which the plea to care for the orphaned baby is written

Laying there he finds a baby, wrapped in sheets with a scarf around their head. He picks it up and while looking at the baby a woman with a stroller walks past towards one of the entrances in the back of the alley. When Chaplin sees her, he tries giving back the baby, assuming she dropped it by accident. She demands him to take it out of the stroller, where he previously placed it. Chaplin does so, and brings the baby back to where he found it next to the bins. A police-officer observes the action and when Chaplin notices the officer, he quickly picks the baby off of the ground and into in his arms again and walks back through the alley, where he came from in the beginning. Around the corner a man is walking and Chaplin approaches him, gets him to hold the baby under the pretence of tying his shoelace and while the man is engrossed in looking at the baby, Chaplin flees back around the corner, abandoning child and man. The now confused man brings the baby to what I assume to be a shop, where he sees a child inside a stroller and places the baby inside it as well, before running away as Chaplin did before. A woman exits the doorway and sees the two children in the stroller, one of which is only hers, obviously. Just as she does, Chaplin walks past, she hurries after him, yelling at him while catching up. It is the same woman, that he already tried to give the child to before in the alley. She hits him multiple times with her umbrella and drags him back to the stroller, having him take the baby out again. He refuses, but when the same officer comes back and the woman tries to engage him in the argument, Chaplin takes the baby and leaves. He sits down on the curb with the child in his arms and contemplates dropping it in the sewer for a second. But he decides agains it. He takes away the sheets from the child’s neck and notices a piece of paper on which is written a plea to take care of the child, which apparently is orphaned. Taking another look at the child, Chaplin picks up his cane, holding the child and walks with it back through the alley he first came through.

He walks past the bricks and is hit by some trash that fell from outside the shot. The line “Awkward ass” appears on a black screen. Chaplin takes out a new cigarette, takes of his gloves, ignites a match with his foot and lights the cigarette. He then throws his gloves in a bin. The next shot shows a crying baby on the floor. He takes a closer look at it and tries to find out where it might have come from by looking up. Chaplin takes up the child. In this moment a woman is walking by in background with a stroller. He walks to her and puts the baby down. The screen says “Pardon me, you dropped something”. The woman starts yelling at the man and he first attempts to take her child away, then his own. The woman furiously walks away. Chaplin then tries to lay the child back on the ground where it came from but a police officer is watching, so he decides to take it with him again. Next Chaplin encounters an old man. He acts like he has to tie his shoelaces and hands the child over to the old man. As soon as he is holding the baby Chaplin runs away. The old man follows him and finds the lady’s stroller. He puts the infant down and walks away. Then the woman returns to her child, only to find the other kid sitting in her stroller again. She sees Chaplin walking by and starts hitting him with her umbrella. She drags him back to the stroller and they argue about the situation. When the police officer returns Chaplin quickly decides to take the child away again. The next scene shows Chaplin and the child alone. They sit down on the street and Chaplin takes a look at the gutter next to him. He decides not to put the child down there and starts playing with it. He suddenly finds a note which he unfolds. It reads: Please love and care for this orphan child. Chaplin smiles at the baby while deciding to keep it. The last shot shows his feet walking away.

He picks it up and tries to get rid of it. A woman with a child in a buggy walks by. The man thinks the baby belongs to her and places the baby in the buggy. The woman, however, becomes angry and hands the baby back to the man. He walks back to where he found the baby and places it on the ground again. When he turns around, he finds a police officer watching him, and, guiltily, picks the baby up again and walks away. In the next scene you see him handing the child to a stranger on the street and running away. The stranger finds the buggy with the child, whose mother is in a shop at that time, again and also places the baby there. Just as the mother discovers the second baby again, the main character walks by and she becomes angry again. She hands him the child, and he sits down next to the street and takes a closer look. He finds a note in the child's clothes that reads ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". In the end, you see him smiling at the baby and walking away with it."

Charly continues walking towards the viewer, smoking a cigarette when another incident like this extinguishes his cigarette. He insults the person responsible as an awkward ass and then proceeds to look for a new cigarette in his cigar box. Once he finds one he taps it onto the lid and then puts it in his mouth while getting a match from the pocket of his vest that he lights at the bottom of his shoe and then tosses into the near garbage bin. After that he also tosses his gloves.  <br/> He looks around and sees an abandoned infant wrapped in blankets lying on the ground next to the garbage bins. He looks around as to find out if one of the people from the upper stories know anything about said child. As he picks it up a woman with a pram walks by in the background. Charly follows her and as she enters a building and leaves the pram with her own child unattended he places the infant in it and attempts to walk away. However, she reacts quite furiously and tells him to take out the baby and then proceeds to walk off in the other direction.  <br/> Charly though places the infant back on the ground where he first found him only to realize that there is a police officer standing right behind him. He then quickly picks up the baby again and walks away. He meets another man and pretends to have stepped into something. He hands over the baby to said man in order to clean off his shoe but then quickly runs back the way he came, leavin the baby with the other man.  <br/> Charly hides in a shed and the other man while looking for him sees the lady's pram and puts the baby in it.

After brushing it off, he lights a cigar just to find a baby lying next to a trashcan. He sees a woman with a baby carriage walking past, and thinks that it has to be her baby. He puts the baby in the carriage and says to her ""You dropped something"". But she insists that it is not her baby, and demands that he takes it back. After reluctantly taking it back, he decides to put the baby where he found it. After realizing that he is being watched by a policeman, he walks off with the baby and crams it into the arms of an elderly man. This man puts the baby into the woman's baby carriage again. When she realizes the strange baby is back in her carriage, she beats up Charlie Chaplin, who was just walking past her at that moment. The policeman reappears, and the woman demands that Charlie Chaplin takes the baby back. After doing so, he  walks through the alleys and ultimately sits down on the pavement. For a moment, he considers putting the baby into a hole leading to the sewage system, but does not act on it. Then he finds a piece of paper in the baby's cloth, which says the baby is an orphan and needs love and care. He walks off with the baby, and it seems like he has decided to keep it."

He takes out his walking stick and bends it a few times in his hands. While he is momentarily distracted, he gets hit by something that was being thrown out of a window, which causes him to drop his cigar. He then proceeds to take out his box of cigars and, after taking off his gloves, lightens another one with the sole of his shoe. After that he throws his gloves in a trash can. That is when he spots an abandoned baby lying behind another trash can. He picks it up and looks around to see who it might belong to and spots a woman with a pram. He hurries over to her and puts the baby in her pram. She gets angry and makes him understand that it isn't hers. He takes the baby out of the pram again and she scuttles away. He walks back to where he found the baby and puts it back down behind the trash can. However, when he realises that a police officer saw him doing so, he picks it back up and hurries away. Then he walks past an elderly man with a walking stick and tricks him into holding the baby while he pretends to tie his shoelaces and runs away. The elderly man hurries after him but can't find him. Instead, he sees a pram with another baby already in it, proceeds to put the baby in it, too, and walks away unnoticed. It turns out, the pram belongs to the woman from earlier, who recognises the baby. By chance, the protagonist walks past her in that moment, not noticing her or the baby. She runs after him and proceeds to beat him with her umbrella while dragging him back to the pram in order for him to take the baby back. The commotion attracts the police officer from earlier causing him to take the baby back and hurry away. Resigned, he sits down on the kerbside and holds the baby in his arm. That is when he finds a note in its blanket which reads ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". He looks at the baby, smiles at it, holds it closer and walks away."

He gets hit by trash falling down from a window above, which makes him lose his cigarette. Thus, he gets a new cigarette out of a metal tin from his pocket. Suddenly, he finds a crying baby on the dirty floor, bundled up in blankets. He looks around, wondering where it came from. He then picks it up and sees a lady with a baby carriage with another baby in it, walking by. Charlie assumes that the baby is probably hers, approaches her and puts the found baby in the baby carriage. The Lady seems outraged and they start arguing. Apparently it is not her baby so Charlie takes it out of the baby carriage, the lady leaves and he puts it back on the floor where he found it. But then a police officer comes walking by, so Charlie is forced to pick the baby back up. He walks around a corner where he sees an older man with a walking stick. Charlie hands him the baby, quickly runs away and hides in a garage. The older man finds the parked baby carriage from the lady from before, who seems to be in a store at that time, and like Charlie before he puts the baby into the carriage and walks away. Charlie comes out of his hideout and walks down the street where the lady comes out of the store. She sees the strange baby in her baby carriage and sees Charlie walking by. She gets very upset, runs after him and beats him with an umbrella, dragging him back to the baby carriage. They start discussing once more, the police officer comes by and as the lady starts to explain the situation, Charlie gives in and once againg takes the baby with him. Not knowing what else to do, he sits down on the sidewalk and for a second he considers putting the baby into the sewer. He then takes a closer look at the baby and, getting a papercut on his finger, he finds a note between the baby's blankets.

Some of the garbage hits his cigar which causes him to light up a new one. As he throws away his worn down gloves, he notices a baby on the floor next to garbage bin and picks it up. While he wonders where it came from, a mother is passing and he puts the child into her pram, thinking that it must be hers. Since he is mistaken she starts protesting and thus Chaplin attempts to return the baby to where he found it. However, he is caught by a police officer and is forced to pick the baby up again. Then he tries to trick a passer-by into holding the baby and runs into hiding. The man follows him but can only find the woman's pram where he leaves the baby. Chaplin comes out of hiding and walks away but the woman, who has already noticed the baby in her pram, sees him and starts beating him with her umbrella. Again, the police officer arrives and Chaplin has to run off with the baby. In another street, he drops his cane and has to sit down to pick it up. For a moment he considers dropping it into the sewers but then takes a closer look at the child. He finds a note that asks the finder to care for the child since it is an orphan. In the end, Chaplin gets up again and decides to take the baby with him.

After lighting another using the sole of his shoe, he throws away his gloves and turns to discover an abandoned infant on the ground. In search of their guardian, he picks up the child and sees a woman walking by. He attempts to drop the baby in her pram only to be turned away, and picks up the woman's own child first before retrieving the lost one. As he returns to the alley to put the baby back where he found it, a policeman positions himself behind him, upon whose discovery he recovers the child. Turning a corner, he happens upon another man to whom he hands the bundle. In his escape, he is pursued by the old man, who places the baby in a pram standing in front of a shop. Just as the mother leaves the building, Chaplin walks past and she beats him with an umbrella. While she drags him back to the baby, the policeman arrives at the scene and Chaplin is forced to take the child back. He sits down on the curb and considers leaving it in the gutter for a short time, but ultimately lets the lid fall shut. As he is regarding the baby, he gets bitten and discovers a note on the child's body, which reads ""Please love and care for this orphan child"".

He assumes the baby was lost by a woman who walks past him with a baby carriage. His attempt to return the child is futile however, as the woman vehemently states that this is not her child. Afterwards he tries to get rid of the baby. He wants to leave the child in the alley, but is stopped by a police officer. His next attempt appears succesful at first. Chaplin hands the baby to an elderly man before quickly running away.  However, the elderly man proceeds to do exactly what Chaplin tried at first. He puts the baby in the baby carriage of the woman we saw earlier. She notices this when Chaplin walks past her, assuming this was his doing. She beats him up und returns the baby to him. Annoyed, he sits down on the sidewalk, where he is tempted to throw the baby into the drain for a second. He hesitates and finds a letter under the childs wrap. It states that the baby is an orphan and asks for someone to love and care for the child. This moves Chaplin and he takes the baby with him with a smile on his face.

The main protagonist is shown walking along a small alley minding his own business, when a series of events unfolds. People are throwing garbage (?) out of their windows, while trying to aim for trash cans but missing them and almost hitting the main protagonist. Soon after that he pulls a box of cigarettes out of his jacket and starts to smoke. While he smokes he realises there is a baby lying on the street right next to him. Curiously he is looking for the parents or someone who might have dropped the baby there but cannot seem to find someone on the first look. However, when he turns around he spots a woman with a stroller and walks towards her. She disappears into a house and he puts the baby into the stroller, supposing she is the mother. The woman appears again and they start to argue, which implies she is not the mother. After almost taking her child, the protagonist picks up the child he found on the street. He then returns to the spot he found the baby in and is placing it there the way he stumbled upon it. When he turns around, there is a police officer standing in front of him, which leads to the protagonist promptly picking up the baby again, because of the implications.  He then walks away and as he passes another man, he pretends he needs to clean his shoes and signals the other man to hold the baby for a second, because he needs both hands in order to clean his footwear. As soon as the other man is holding the baby, the protagonis makes a run for it and hides somewhere in the previously shown alley. While looking for the protagonist, the second man comes across the same stroller shown before, getting the same idea as the protagonist and placing the baby in the woman's stroller. This time the woman does not realise that immediately as she is not present during this event. The moment she appears again and sees the second baby, the protagonist walks by her which leads her to running after him and hitting him with her umbrella, forcing him to take the baby again. He then sits down on a pavement and contemplates dropping the baby in the sewer. He takes a closer look at the baby and inside the blankets covering the baby, there is a letter with the words ""Please love and care for this orphan child."". This immediately changes the protagonist's stance towards the child as he realises the parents are not around anymore to raise the baby and he feels responsible for it now and walks away as a newfound father."

He dodges some garbage being thrown out of a window but shortly after entering an alley way he is hit by another load of what looks like food scraps. It looks like in the process he lost his cigarette and so he takes another out of a metal box containing cigarettes and cigars. After taking off his gloves he lights a match by scraping it across the sole of his shoe, lights his cigarette and then throws both the match and his gloves away. Shortly after, the man notices a baby on the ground next to some garbage cans and, after apparently looking around in the air for the origin of the baby picks it up. In the background a woman pushing a pram can be seen walking by. The man turns around and while the woman isn't looking deposits the baby next to the woman's baby that is already inside the pram. The woman returns and the man tells her that she dropped something. She is not impressed by this and demands that he take the baby away again. After first trying to take the wrong baby, the man takes the correct baby to the place where he found it. Turning around, he comes face to face with a police officer and immediately turns around to pick the baby back up again and walks away with it in his arms. Next, he tries to give the baby to an older man walking down a street with a cane by pretending that he has to tie his shoe and after the older man has the baby in his arms he runs away and hides. The older man follows him and comes across the pram of the same women seen earlier. He deposits the baby into the pram and walks away. The man comes out from his hiding place and walks past the woman and her pram again, who has discovered that the same baby has been pushed onto her again. She sees the man walk past and beats him up with her umbrella, dragging him back to the baby by the scruff of his neck and demanding that he take it back. The police officer can be seen approaching and the woman seems to accuse the man, who takes the baby back and sits down on a curb with it. He seems to contemplate putting the baby inside of a street drain, but decides against it. After searching the babies clothes he finds a note saying ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". The man smiles at the baby and walks away with it in his arms."

A window opens and somebody throws several pieces of garbage out, missing Chaplin every time. Chaplin keeps strolling, not noticing anything. Another window opens, somebody throws out a big amount of garbage, apparently aiming at the trash can standing underneath the window. The garbage lands on Chaplin instead. He's startled and apparently feels awkward, so he takes off his gloves and lights himself a cigarette. Not wanting to put his gloves back on, he throws them into the trash can and leaves. At the corner of the street he finds a baby lying on the ground, crying. He picks it up, gazes at the houses surrounding him. Just at that moment a mother with a child in a stroller walks by and enters a house, leaving the stroller in front of the open door. Chaplin puts the baby into the stroller when the mother comes back. She seems furious, aggressively asks him to take the baby back. Chaplin grabs the baby, they both leave in opposite directions. Chaplin goes back to the corner where he found the baby, puts it on the ground. At that moment, a police officer walks by and witnesses Chaplin leaving the baby. Chaplin attempts to leave the place, turns around, sees the police officer, picks up the baby again and leaves. Next scene. An old man with a walking stick walks down a street, Chaplin is approaching from behind. He pretends that he needs to tie his shoe, gives the baby to the man, then runs away, hiding behind a corner. The old man runs after him. When he can't find him, he notices a stroller standing in front of a house. He puts the baby into the stroller and leaves. Moments later, when Chaplin accidentally walks by, the mother comes out of the house, seeing an additional baby in the stroller and Chaplin walking by. She gets furious again, runs after him and beats him with her umbrella. They argue over the baby in the stroller, when the police officer walks by. The woman gesticulates wildly. Chaplin picks up the baby again and leaves. Next scene. Chaplin sits down on the pavement, a gully next to him. He opens it, pparently thinking about dropping the baby down the gully. He discards the idea and examines the babie's clothes instead, finding a note. The note says ""Please love and care for this orphaned child"". Chaplin looks at the babie's face, smiles, gets up and leaves with the baby."

He picks up the crying baby and tries to sneak it into a pram a mother left on the street while running errands. The mother notices and gets angry at Chaplin, who then has to take the baby back. He then tried to lay it back where he found it, but a police man catches him, so Chaplin has to take the baby again. He sees an old man and asks him to hold the baby so Chaplin can tie his shoes. The old man takes the baby and Chaplin runs away. Since the old man is not fast enough to catch him, he lays the baby into the first pram he can find, which is coincidentally the same pram in which Chaplin already has put the baby.  The angry mother thought Chaplin was at fault, found him and handed the baby back. Chaplin sits down on a curb and does not know what he should do with this baby. He even had a quick thought about dumping it in the sewage. Finally Chaplin starts searching in the cloth and blankets the baby is swaddled in and finds a note. The note says „ please love and care for this orphan child“. Now he starts to smile and hold the baby close, accepting his fate.

Because he is scared that the baby is going to get hit by rubble that previously fell down on him, too, he picks it up, but does not really seem to know what to do with it. He then sees a woman with a pram and tries to put the child in there. The mother, however, of course notices that this is not her child and makes him take it out again, so Chaplin tries to lay it back down to where he found it, but is caught by a police officer, so he picks it up again. After running around trying to find somewhere to put the baby, he gives it to another man and quickly runs away. That man puts it in the woman's pram again and flees, too. When Chaplin walks past the woman after he was hiding somewhere, she thinks that it was him putting the baby back in there again and hits him with her umbrella until he takes the baby back. After Chaplin even debates leaving it in the drain, he finds a note on the child that states that this child is an orphan, and asks the finder to take care of it and love it. This is where he finally comes to terms with his fate and starts taking care of the baby.

After being hit by rubble twice and lighting a cigarette, he discovers a baby on the ground, wrapped in a blanket. Visibly puzzled, the man gazes around, trying to find out who the baby might belong to. He then picks it up and notices a woman pushing a stroller passing by. He places the baby into the stroller across from another baby, but takes it back after the woman gets mad at him. The man then decides to put the baby back on the ground where he found it, but changes his mind when he encounters a police officer. The man notices an old man with a walking cane and tricks him into holding the baby, whereupon the first man runs off. The old man puts the baby in the same stroller as the previous man and walks away. When the first man walks by the stroller, he gets beaten by the woman and gives in, taking back the baby. Finally, he sits down on the curb, discovers a note hidden in the baby's blanket saying that it is an orphan child. This causes the man to lovingly engage with the child and walk away.

He picks up the crying baby and tries to get rid of it by radomly placing it into the hands of other people he comes across. But somehow the unwanted baby always finds a way back to him. At the same time, a guard or police officer is suspiciously watching the events surrounding the man and the baby. In the end, the man sits down on the pavement and slowly starts to accept his fate and duty to take care of the baby. He then takes a closer look at the baby and finds a note attached to its clothes in which it is revealed that the baby is an orphan.

He picks it up, seems confused and then notices a lady walk past, with a baby in a pram. The lady leaves her push chair outside a shop and Charles Chaplin sneakily sits the child in the push chair next to the lady's baby. He gets told off by the woman and they have  massive row. Charles Chaplin takes the baby, lays it back in the corner, gets caught and chased by a police officer and hands the child to a homeless person who then has the same idea as Chaplin, namely putting the baby back in the woman's pram. The lady sees Charles Chaplin potter along and holds him responsible. She yells at him and gives him the baby. After sitting down with the little one on his lap, Charles finds a note on the baby which states that it's an orphan.

He picks up the baby and is convinced that he has found the mother when he sees a woman with a buggy walking by. Indicating that it is not her baby, the woman refuses to take the child. The protagonist puts the baby down on the ground and apparently wants to walk off when a police officer enters the scene whereupon the protagonist changes his mind and picks up the baby again. In an attempt to solve the situation, the protagonist hands the baby over to a stranger in the streets and runs off. Irritated, the stranger tries to chase the protagonist but as he is not able to find him he puts the baby in a buggy of a woman, who, by conincidence, is the same woman from the scene in the beginning. When she sees the protagonist passing by, she runs after him and hits him with her umbrella, obviously convinced that he again had put the baby in the buggy. In the final scene of the video, after comtemplating to drop the baby in the sewerage, the protagonist finds a note on the baby saying that the child is an orphan that needs love and caring. The protagonist seems to changes his mind and walks off with the baby and a smile on his face.
