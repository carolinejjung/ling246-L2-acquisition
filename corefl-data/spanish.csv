Suddenly, the man starts to smoke and in that moment he found a baby laying and crying on the floor. It seems that someone had left him there. Behind him, a woman appears with another baby, and the man gives her the baby he found thinking it could be hers. The woman denies him and the man comes back to the place he found him and put him on the floor, however a policeman appears and the man takes the baby again. Lately the man comes across an old man, he gives him the baby and run away. The old man comes across  with the other baby and puts them together. The woman suddenly appears again and sees the man; she runs to him and hit him. Again, the policeman appears and she starts to accuse him of leaving the baby, so the man takes the baby and goes away. He sits down with the baby and found a note in the baby's clothes in which he reads ""please love and care for this orphan baby"""

The protagonist is walking down the street while smoking. In the scene we can see a woman throwing objects out the window. Walking through a place where there is garbage, he picks up another cigarette and while smoking it, he finds a baby on the ground abandoned. He decides to pick it up and at that moment he finds a woman with a stroller for two babies. Seeing that this woman only had one baby in the cart, he places it in the other part of it, thinking that it would belong to the woman. The woman returns the baby to him because it was not hers. Not finding his parents, he places him where he was but at that moment, a policeman appears so he must pick up the baby again so as not to be scolded by the agent. Walking down the street, he gives the baby to a man who passes by. The man, not wanting the baby, casually places the baby in the stroller of the woman who appeared earlier. When the woman realized that the baby was back in the stroller, she blames Chaplin. In addition, the policeman appears, so Chaplin keeps the baby. At the end we see how the baby carried a note that said take care of him. Chaplin decides to stay with him permanently.

Suddenly, he found a little baby crying in the middle of the street and Chaplin did not know exactly what to do. He came up with the idea of giving it to the woman he saw a little after, since she was carrying her baby in a baby buggy, but the woman rejected inmediatedly due to the fact that that child was not her baby. Then, he was going to place the baby in the same spot he was found but a policy agent was watching him, so he could not. After that, he came up with the idea of giving it to a strange with the following excuse ""can you hold my baby for a second please?"". Surprisingly, he could get rid of the baby, but it was just for a minute, since the strange placed the baby in the same baby buggy that Chaplin did, so the woman hit Chaplin several times as soon as she saw him again. Finally, Chaplin had to get the baby out of there and when he was far enough he planned to throw it to the sewage. However, he founded a letter between the cloths of the baby, in which was written the following sentence: ""Please take care of the child"" and after reading that, Chaplin couldn't do anything else than taking care of the baby by his own."

He takes him and starts to look for someone. At the same time, a lady appears behind him carrying a baby cart, the lady goes upstairs and he leaves the baby in the cart. The lady appears again, she looks very upset and tells him that she is not the responsible of the baby, he is not hers. He tries to get rid of  the baby, leaving him in the same place where he found him but in that moment, a sheriff comes up and he has to lift the baby again. He starts to walk looking for a place to leave the baby without being seen. He finds an old man, gives the baby to him and runs, hiding him from the man. This one finds the baby cart's woman on his way and leaves the baby on it. The lady finds the baby in her cart again. Chaplin is passing by there at that point and she runs behind him and starts to beat him with an umbrella. The policeman is walking around there again and she blames Chaplin for the baby. He takes the baby and looks, desperately, for a place to leave him. He finds a drain on the floor and thinks about putting him inside, but finally, he feels sorry for the baby and does not do it. At the end of the video, Chaplin finds a note in the baby's clothes that says: take care and love this orphan child. He smiles and goes back home carrying the baby.

Besides, he talks to a woman with another baby and asks to her if it is her baby too. She denies it so he brings the baby back to the bin but a police man sees him. Afterwards he sees an old man in the street, gives the baby to him and runs away. Apart from that, the old man leaves the baby in the women's baby stroller. Moreover, when she finds the baby there she suspects of Chaplin and starts sticking him with an umbrella. On the other hand, she tells everything to the policeman so Chaplin takes the baby with him and goes away.

Firstly, Chaplin is walking calmly when suddenly a lot of rubbish falls on him, then Chaplin decides to light a cigarrette with a match. Later, he finds a baby in the middle of the street, he doesn't know what to do so he starts to walk with the baby until he sees a woman with a baby carriage. Chaplin thinks that the baby is likely to belong to that woman so he puts the baby on the carriage but the woman gets angry and she tells him that the baby is not hers. Chaplin comes back to the street and he leaves the baby again on the floor but when he turns around, he bumps into a policeman and as a consequence he picks up the baby again. Chaplin, with a touch of humour, puts the baby on an unkown man's arms and he runs. The unkown man is now confussed but he finds the same carriage in which Chaplin had left the baby before. The man leaves the baby in the carriage like Chaplin and he goes. The upset woman, that has discovered the baby again in her carriage, sees Chaplin taking a walk so she believes that he was the guilty. The woman givesthe baby back to Chaplin. Chaplin, very desperate, doesn't know how to act, he walks with the baby when suddenly, he sees a note among the blankets of the baby, the note says: ''Please love and care for this orphan child''.

He decides to smoke a cigarrete and when he looks down, he discovered a baby crying. First, he thinks one lady has left him there by mistake so he put him in her baby trolley with another baby, but the woman refuses to take him since that was not her baby. After that, he tries, to left him in the same place he found him in the first place, but a policeman catches him and he take the baby back. Thirdly, he tries to left him to an old man. This time, he gets to scape but the old man puts him back into the same trolley so, when Chaplin passes by there, the woman hits him with her umbrella and retuns the baby to him. Finally, desparate, he thinks in leaving the baby in the sewers, but quickly rejects that idea. Then, he discovers a letter in the baby's clothes which says that he is an orphan and please, take care of him, and he does.

He then puts his cane on his left arm, takes off his right glove and slowly his left glove. Takes the cigaro that he saved and lits it with the sole of his shoe and smokes. After that, he throws the gloves to the bin and shakes his hands. When he looks to his left, he sees a little baby. Aftet wondering why he is here or why isn't anyone there, picks them. He looks behind him and sees a woman with a trolley and tries to call her.

They start arguing and Chaplin takes the baby he picked and leaves. He decides to leave the baby where he encountered it but when he turns back he sees a police officer and takes again the baby. Walking down the street he noticed that his shoes aren't tied.

Them, he takes the baby and tries to leave him with an old man, but the man refuses to take him. Immediately, he puts the baby with another baby in a carriage, but the mother does not want two babies. Finally, he sits with the baby in a passage and he finds a note left in the baby's clothes, “please care for this orphan child.” He looks at the baby fondly and takes him.

What happens next makes him feel confused: he finds a baby on the floor. As a woman comes by with a baby buggy, Charles Chaplin thinks that the baby might have fallen out of it, so he puts him on it with the other child, but the woman gets angry with him and tells him to take his kid and stay away from them. Later, Chaplin tries to return the baby to where he found him, however, as a policeman is watching him, he has to take the kid again with him. Then, Chaplin attempts to leave the child with an old man by faking that he has to tie his shoes and running afterwards. Nevertheless, the old man leaves the child on a baby buggy he founds, which is that from the woman that appeared on the previous scene. When she notices the new baby and identifies Chaplin on the street, she attacks him with her umbrella and makes him take the unknown child with him again. Meanwhile, the policeman observes them. Later, he thinks about leaving the child in a sewer, but refuses the idea and, when he does, he finds a letter inside the baby clothes and discovers that it is an orphan kid. Finally, he decides to keep the baby with him and leaves.

He is not that lucky with the second person who's doing the same, and all the garbage falls on him. He seems a little bit upset and shakes off his suit; then, he picks one of the many unfinished cigars he has in his tobacco pouch, takes off his gloves, lights a match with the sole of his shoe and starts smoking, finally throwing his gloves to the bin next to him. All of a sudden, a baby starts crying, the poor thing is wrapped with sheets next to somebody's trash. Chaplin looks up, left and right, confused. He decides to take the baby when a woman, pushing a pram, is crossing the street behind; he thinks the baby might be hers and leaves him or her inside with the other baby. The woman starts yelling at him/her so, he takes him/her back to where he found him/her. But, a police officer, who's watching, thinks he is abandoning the baby; therefore, Chaplin has to take the kid again in his arms and leaves. He finds an old man, and asks him to take the baby while he fixes his shoe, but he runs away. The old man goes after him but he is hidden. <br/> The old man sees the pram half empty and lies the baby there. Chaplin comes out of his secret place and walks the officer again as if nothing would have happened. When he thinks it all has ended, he runs into the woman with the pram and she hits him with her umbrella, forcing him to take the baby; the presence of the officer in the scene again makes him leave quickly with the kid in his arms, not so sure of what to do. He seats on the sidewalk,  looking at the baby and he finds a note in the sheets the kid's covered with which says 'please, love and care for this orphan child', and he finally keeps him/her.

He grabs him and, as he did't know what to do with the poor baby, he drops him or her in a baby carriage of a woman he comes up there. But the woman gets mad about it and Chaplin has to take the baby back and leave him or her back in the street. Then, another man shows up and grabs the baby as well but he doesn't know what to do with him or her, so, again, he leaves the baby in the same baby carriage that he finds while the owner is not looking. As the police is waching around, these characters are trying to scape from him. Finally, Chaplin has to grab the baby again, but he discovers a note that the baby has hidden between the blankets. This note says to take care of the baby with love, so that is what Chaplin finally does.

He later throw his gloves to the rubbish bin.  <br/> At some point, he saw a baby in a corner of the street, right behind another bin, and hold him up to see him more clearly. Then, he sees a woman with another child and thinks that she might have lost that baby so he places him on the baby carriage. The woman seems upset by this reaction because it is not her baby and hits Chaplin to show her anger and make him go away. As a result, Chaplin goes again to the corner where he found the baby, in order to put him where he was found. However, a policeman saw him and angrily told him not to do so, which makes Chaplin move to another street, where he finds a man and, pretending that he has to tie her shoelaces, he tricks the man to get rid of the baby and leaving him in the arms of this man. This person, in another street, sees a baby carriage and decides to place the baby there in order to get rid of him. However, the woman, when she comes out of the grocery shop, sees Chaplin walking down the street and, again, hits him to show her annoance and make him go back to the carriage and take the baby again.  <br/> With the baby in his arms, Chaplin is confused and tired. He does not know what to do with the baby. He even thought about placing him in the drain. Nevertheless, he finds a note in the baby clothes.

He keeps on walking while he is smoking a cigarette, and he is attacked again, but this time by a different person who throws his or her trash out of the window. Chaplin seems a bit angry; however, he checks a box he is carrying with him in order to smoke another cigarette again. Once he starts smoking, he takes off his gloves and decides to throw them in the bin next to him. Just when he throw them away he hears some noise, like a baby crying, so what he does is to turn around and sees that there is a baby alone in the street wrapped up in blankets. He begins to analyse the situation and looking everywhere because leaving a baby in the street is a very cruel act. While he is taking the baby with him, there is a woman with a baby carriage walking behind him. Chaplin sees her so he walks towards her with the intention of leaving her the baby. He leaves the baby in the carriage and the woman beings to argue with him because the baby is not hers; therefore, Charles has to take the baby with him again and wants to leave him in the place where he found him. However, at that moment a pollice officer appears behing him and sees what Charles Chaplin is doing. He is caught in the action and the policeman believes he is abandoning his baby. When Chaplin sees the officer behind him, he quickly takes the baby with him again and starts walking down the street. He runs into a man and gives him the baby with the excuse that he needs to tie his shoes, so he is pretending he is doing that when all of a sudden he runs away. The man notices what Chaplin has done and goes everywhere looking for him but he cannot find him because he is hidden. That man fins a baby carriage in the street so he decides to leave the baby in it and runs away. Chaplin leaves his hiding place and walks next to the baby carriage exactly when the woman appears and sees the new baby in her carriage. As she sees the baby, she sees Chaplin too, so she thinks that the one that let the baby there was him and not the other man; therefore she follows him and starts hitting him with her umbrella. The policeman observes the situation and the woman argues with him and with Chaplin, so he is forced to take the baby with again. He sits down in the pavement next to a sewer and watches it with the intention of leaving the baby there, but finally he does ot do that. He checks the baby and fins a letter in the blankets that says ""please love and care for this orphan child"". Then, the video finishes with him looking at the baby and smiling at him."

As he does not know where the baby has dropped from, he thinks that it may belong to a woman that has other baby, thus, he puts the baby into the baby cart of the woman. However, the woman denies that the baby is hers. He is uncertain about what to do with the baby, so, he decides to leave them on the ground where he found them.

Immediately, he runs away and hides at the same time that the old man holds the baby. That old man finds the same woman with the baby cart and he introduces the baby there. Then, the woman sees the first man walking around and thinks that he has put the baby inside the baby cart again, therefore, he had to pick up the baby.

He wonders why the baby is there alone and sees a lady walking by with another baby. He runs to place the abandoned baby next to the lady’s kid. However, she realises it and he has to keep the baby for himself.  <br/> After that, he decides to leave him on the ground again, but a police officer catches him doing it and he has to keep him.

At first, we can see Charles wandering around a poor neighbourhood, when all of a sudden a pile of rubbish is thrown at him. He does not take this into account and proceeds to light up a cigar. Suddenly, he notices that a baby is lying in the ground. Since a woman is walking by with her child, Charles thinks that the baby he has just found is hers. Therefore, he places the baby in the stroller. Nevertheless, she responds angry to Charles owing to the fact that the baby does not belong to her. As a result, he has to take the baby again with him and decides to leave him back in the place where he found him. However, a policeman discovers what Charles aims to do. Despite the fact that he cannot leave the baby there, he eventually finds a man who he asks to hold the baby for a second, which gives Charles time to escape. This man chases Chaplin but he finds a stroller, where he leaves the baby. Charles comes out of the place in which he had hidden and finds the policeman, so he has to run away again. Nevertheless, Charles passes by the stroller and the same woman he had previously encountered tells him furiously that the baby is not hers. Consequently, he has to take the baby. Finally, Charles sits on the ground holding the baby when all of a sudden he finds a piece of paper in which it is asked to please take care and love the poor child. In the end, he decides to take the baby with him and love him.

Later, he tries to leave the baby at the same spot where he found it, but a police officer sees him so he tried again by gaving the newborn to a random man who was patiently strolling. Then this man returns the baby to the same lady and the baby ends in Chaplins hands again. He gives up and keeps it.

He then put the baby back where he found it but a police officer caught him red-handed so Chaplin picked it up again. He kept on walking until he saw an old man with a walking stick and left the baby with him. This old man found the  lady with the stroller and put them back in. Chaplin passed by and the lady thought it had been him again who had left the baby there, so she hit him with her umbrella and made him take the baby back.

At first, he thinks someone might have dropped him by accident so he tries to return it to a woman passing by with her own baby, but she yells at him, probably because she believes he is trying to get rid of his baby. When Chaplin runs away from the angry mother, he puts the baby back when he found him; nevertheless, a policeman unexpectedly appears and he has to take the baby with him. However, he still tries to get rid of the poor creature by giving it to an old man and running away. The old man tries to chase him, but when he is unable to do so, he just tries to give the baby to someone else as well. He encounters the same mother Chaplin had already tried to give the baby to and runs away. When Chaplin passes by the woman and she realises the baby is there, she beats him up and screams at him violently. When the same policeman approaches to see what is happening, Chaplin just takes the baby again and goes away to avoid conflict. He seems to wonder what is he going to do with him when he realises there is a note between the clothes that wrap the child. In the note, the father or mother of the baby asks for whoever that encounters him, to please love and take care of him. Then, Chaplin decides to take the baby with him.

When he gets to an alley and lits a cigarette, he finds a child, very little and wrapped in a scarf, in the dirt pavement. Apparently by chance, a woman passes by with a baby trolley and the man, thinking the woman dropped the child unintentionally, places the baby in the carrier. The woman gets really mad that he has tried to place an unknown child with hers and forces him to take it back. After many unsuccessful attempts at getting rid of the baby, the man finds a handwritten letter pleading with whoever found it to care for the child. The man ultimately heeds this, and we are led to believe he does so.

Then, he takes a cigarette. While he's smoking, he sees a baby on the street. He takes it and looks for someone who could have left it there. As he doesn't find anybody, he leaves the baby in a pram he notices. But the pram's woman complains and holds him the baby again. He tries to abandon it on the street, where he found it, but a police man sees him, so he tries to escape, not to get caught by the police man. After that, he leaves the baby with a man, who puts the baby into the previously mentioned pram, and the pram's woman gives the baby to Chaplin for a second time. Eventually, Chaplin sits down and looks at the baby while holding it, when he notices about a hidden paper in the baby clothes. He takes it and reads the message written: the baby is an orphan kid. Chaplin smiles.

He is proceeding to leave the baby where he found it but a police officer comes by and he is forced to take back the baby.

When Chaplin passes by the trolley, the mom sees him and chases him while scolding him so he picks up the baby and take it out of the trolley. The police officer is nearby so Chaplin feels responsible for picking up the baby and after walking with it in his arms, he sits down next to a sewer and opens it while contemplating the option of throwing the baby down, but soon after he discovers a letter which was wrapped in the baby's blanket which says something along the lines ""please take good care of me"", so he smiles at that and decides to keep the baby."

As he is grunting about what has just happened, he takes a cigarette butt out of the tin box he keeps in his pocket. After taking his gloves off, he lights a matchstick with the sole of his shoe and starts smoking the butt. When he is about to set his journey again, his attention is driven to a baby lying on the floor, all wrapped up in blankets. He then sees a woman with a stroller, and he decides to follow her carting the baby in his arms. He tries to make the woman believe that she has dropped the baby out od the stroller, but she does not seem very convinced about that idea as she starts yelling at Chaplin. Then he returns to the same place the flowerpot landed on and he restored the baby to where he found him or her.  <br/>  <br/> At that very moment, a police officer sees Chaplin leaving the baby behind and so Chaplin decides to take the baby with him. As he strolls down the road, he pretends to need to lace his shoes and he entrusts the baby to a man in the street. When that man is distracted with the baby, Chaplin escapes and hides from the man who is chasing him. This latter man also sees that very same woman from before and leaves the baby in the stroller once again, but the woman thinks that it was Chaplin who put the baby inside the stroller and not the bearded man. After being beaten up with an umbrella, Chaplin takes the baby once more, but this time under the watchful eye of the police officer and he leaves.  <br/>  <br/> Chaplin, resigned, sits down on the pavement, and takes a letter from the wrapped baby. The letter says: “Please love and care for this orphan child”. It seems that Chaplin was moved by this short note as he leaves with the baby in his arms.

After picking a new one from his case, takes out his worn-out gloves and lights it. After walking for a while finds a baby lying on the floor, crying. He picks it and, after seeing a woman walking by with a baby stroller, he thinks that child may be hers, so Chaplin puts it on her stroller. Charles argues with her, as it wasn't her baby, and when Chaplin tries to leave the baby where it was, a police officer sees him, with an inquisitive look so Chaplin walks away with the baby to find an old man, and tricks him to pick the baby while he ties his shoes, so he can run away. The old man, after finding the same atroller as Chaplin, leaves the kid there and walks away. The woman who was pushing the stroller finds the baby there, surprised, and when Chaplin is walking nearby, she hits him with her umbrella and forces him to take the child, with a little help from the silent police officer. After a short walk, Chaplin sits on the sidewalk near a sewer, and thinks about trowing the baby away, but eventually finds a note saying it's an orphan child, so he pities the baby and takes it with him.

Chaplin	written_online	15	Outside classroom	""	Chaplin is walking as a builder throws rubble from an apartment above. He cleans the dust off of himself and continues walking and smoking a cigar. Suddenly, someone throws rubbish to him from above. He stops, swears at the person above and takes a can out of his pocket that contains several half-smoked cigars. He takes one, lights a match with the sole of his shoe and throws his gloves to the bin. He looks to the left to discover a crying baby who has been abandoned on the street. He approaches and checks on him. Then, he looks at the surrounding buildings looking for the possible parents of the child. After seeing nobody, he decides to grab him while a woman with a trolley passes by. Chaplin notices the woman and chases her. When the woman stops to enter one of the houses, Chaplin leaves the child on the woman’s trolley just to see her come back yelling at Chaplin. The woman tells Chaplin, very angrily, that the baby is not hers, so Chaplin grabs the baby again and the woman leaves. Chaplin returns to where he found the baby and leaves him/her there again. When he turns around, he bumps into an officer and immediately turns around to take the baby and leave. As he is walking by, he sees an old man walking with a stick. Chaplin tells the man to hold the baby while he ties his shoe. When the man holds the baby, Chaplin pretends to tie his left shoe and a second after he runs away, leaving the man with the baby. The man chases Chaplin, who hides in a small room next to where the baby was found. The old man, not being able to find Chaplin, leaves the baby on the woman’s trolley. Chaplin exits the room where he was hiding and comes across another officer. He turns around and leaves. In the next scene, two people walk by the trolley and the woman goes out of the shop. The woman sees the baby on the trolley and shows herself incredulously. Chaplin passes by the woman, who takes an umbrella and runs to him. She starts to beat him with the umbrella. She grabs him by the jacket and takes him to the trolley. They start an argument about the baby and the woman calls an officer. The woman explains the situation to the officer and Chaplin takes the baby again, without the officer telling him to. They all leave. Chaplin walks on the sidewalk and drops his stick next to a drain. Then, he sits on the sidewalk to pick up the stick. He opens the drain and looks at the baby, thinking about dropping him inside. He frowns and closes the drain. He stares at the baby and starts talking to him/her. When the changes the baby to his right lap, Chaplin stabs himself with a pin that is on the baby’s blanket. He looks into the folds of the blanket and finds a note, which was held with the pin. He takes out the note and pokes the pin on his blazer. He unfolds the note, which reads “please love and care for this orphan child”. Chaplin, moved by the note, looks at the baby and keeps the note in a pocket of his blazer. He starts smiling at the baby, takes his stick and they both leave.

Bothered by the situation, he takes a cigarette from his case and looks around him trying to find the responsible of that action. While he is looking, he notices that, behind him, there is an abandoned baby lying on the floor. A confused Chaplin distinguishes a woman walking down the street with a baby stroller and, therefore, he runs towards her leaving the baby in the troller. When the lady notices about this, she gets mad since she does not recognise the baby. Chaplin and the woman argue and rapidly he comes back with the baby to the place where he found it. Then, he leaves the child again on the floor abandoning it. However, when he tries to escape, a policeman witnesses him. Chaplin takes again the baby and runs. During the chase, he leaves the baby with an old man but, subsequently, the old man leaves the baby with the aforementioned woman and then disappears. Unfortunately for Chaplin, the woman sees him again and assumes that he is the one who has left the baby in the stroller, then the woman, violently, punches him. Chaplin is forced again to take the baby and run. Apparently exhausted, he sits down in the pavement holding the child. Then he notices that within the baby’s clothes there is a note with a message that confirms that the baby is an orphan child. Finally, he opts to adopt it.

At the beginning of the video, Chaplin leaves a building, and not far from there, he has a little accident with what it seems to be ruins of a construction. Later, this man decides to smoke a cigarette, and so he takes one from a box from inside his coat and lights the cigarette with his shoe. When he starts walking again, he finds a little baby on the corner of the street. He decides to pick up the baby and put it inside a chariot he finds not far from there. When the woman returns and finds out someone has put a baby inside, she immediately starts to what it seems shouting at Chaplin. Then, this man takes back the baby he had found and tries to put it back where he was. However, a police officer appears on the scene, so again, Chaplin picks up the baby, and this time he gives it to another man. This new man takes the baby, and he find the chariot of the previous scene and tries the same thing Chaplin had done. The man leaves the scene and when the woman finds out about the baby, Chaplin happens to be walking passed her, and so he's blamed for this action. The protagonist decides to take the baby with him and sits on the boarder of the pavement considering to put the baby inside the sewer but this only lasts for a few seconds in his mind. At the end of the video Chaplin finds what it seems to be a note from the baby's parent asking for someone to take care of this child. The man then smiles and keeps the baby with him.

He picks up the baby, and tries to give it to a woman passing by with her own baby. The woman rejects taking care of the baby so Chaplin picks it up again, and tries to return it to the previous place where he found it. However, a police officer catches him in the act so he picks up the baby one more time. Going down the street, Chaplin sees a man and tricks him to hold the baby while Chaplin ties his boots so that he could get out of there without the baby. This man, trying to find Chaplin, sees the same baby carriage where Chaplin had unsuccessfully left the baby the first time, and leaves it there. The woman, furious about this, tries to find a solution when, unfortunately for Chaplin, he passes by in front of the woman. She chases him with an umbrella to pick the baby and carries it with him. Finally, Chaplin decides to take care of the baby since anyone else is willing to do it.

Later, when he saw a mother with a buggy and her baby, Chaplin thought the baby he found could probably be hers and put him on that same buggy, but the woman said it was not hers and Chaplin took the baby back again. Thus, he tried to leave this kid back on the floor but he picked him up as soon as he noticed there was a police near him. Worried because of having this small kid, he convinced a man to take him/her for a while while he fled. Unfortunately for Chaplin, this man put the baby back on the mother's buggy without being caught by anyone. Hence, when the mother saw Chaplin again, she made him to take the baby out of his buggy. Finally, this hopeless Chaplin, sat down with the kid on his arms, realized that this was an abandoned baby left with a note. After reading it, Chaplin changed his mind about the baby and we can imagine that he looked after the baby as the paper he read only asked for this baby to be loved as he had been abandoned.

He is struggling to avoid the rubble while smoking a cigar when he suddenly sees a baby lying on the floor. He picks it up and brings it to a woman carrying a pram, who refuses to take him though. Back with the baby, Chaplin gives the kid this time to an old man, trying to avoid the policeman who is following him. However, the old man puts the baby again in the pram of the woman, making her mad. Chaplin has no option but to take the kid and leave. He finally ends pitying the baby and taking care of him.

In the first scene of the video, Chaplin is in the middle of an alley, where people are throwing away what seems to be rubble and dirt until one person throws rubbish upon him. In a close-up image of Chaplin, we can see he is wearing mittens and grab a cigarette just before seeing a baby abandoned in the middle of the alley. As he does not know what to do with this child, he tries to get rid of him in different ways. First, he tries to get the baby in a lady’s baby pushchair, with another baby in it. He is caught, so he tries to leave the baby in the same place he found it, being caught again by a police officer. In his third attempt, he manages to do get rid of the baby, leaving him with a bearded man. However, eventually, the baby ends up again in the lady’s pushchair and as she recognises Chaplin, she told him off and calls the same police officer that was patrolling there. Finally, Chaplin, just when he is about to leave the kid in the sewage system, finds a note, in which someone wrote that this kid is an orphan and requests that whoever has found him to take care of him. This final letter seems to be the conclusive reason for Chaplin to adopt the child.

This bizarre outfit gives him a funny air. He has a cigarette between his lips and when he blows the smoke comes as if he was a steam locomotive. He walks like nothing around him matters, like he is oblivious of his surrounding. He passes below an open window, from which a man appears and throw something white, perhaps dust or flour, who knows. Mr. Chaplin looks at the fallen thing just for a second and continues with his walk in that clumsy way he has. He approaches and gets closer and closer. And while he walks, he changes the cane he is holding from one hand to another and plays with it and bends it. Suddenly, something from above falls on his head and this time it really bothers him. He looks up and down trying to find from where that thing comes. Then, from his pocket he gets a tin, a tobacco tin, he opens it and take one cigarette. Then, he takes the tin back to his pocket and after removing his gloves he lights the cigarette and starts smoking again. He gets rid of the gloves by throwing them into a bin and when he looks at his right he finds a baby crying wrapped up in a blanket. He looks everywhere trying to find his parents. “Where this baby comes from?”, he seems to wonder. He takes the baby in his arms and in the distance he sees a woman pushing a baby buggy. Thinking that perhaps she is the baby’s mother, Mr. Chaplin puts the baby inside the buggy. When the women finds out, she starts yelling at him and he can do nothing but to take the baby away and retrieve the poor thing to his or her original place. However, a policeman just appears from nowhere and looks at him in an earnest way that makes Mr. Chaplin take the baby again in a rush and leave. Afterwards, he finds an old man walking in a cane; he gives the baby to him and flees. The old man goes after him but Mr. Chaplin hides away. In his way, trying to find Mr. Chaplin, the old man just by chance finds the baby baggy mentioned above and leaves the baby inside it and runs away. When the woman finds out that there was an “intruder”, she gets really crossed. The funny thing is that Mr. Chaplin walks in front of her own eyes, so the women goes after him shouting and raising her umbrella and pointing it at him. She starts striking him repeatedly, shouting at him and demanding an explanation. The policeman appears and approaches since these two are enrolled in an argument, the woman explains what has just happened and Mr. Chaplin just takes the baby away once again. He seats down and next to him finds a gutter and opens it. For just a moment, he weights his possibilities. However, something happens: the baby carries a note which reads “Please, love and care for this orphan child”. Mr. Chaplin looks at the baby with compassion and kindness, takes him in his arms and without raising his eyes from him, leaves the scene.
