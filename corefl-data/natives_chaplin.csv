He didn't know what to do but when he saw a women with a carriage, he thought it was hers and gave it back. It wasn't the women's baby and so he had to take it back. He then tried to put the baby back where he found it but then a police officer showed up so he picked up the baby and kept walking. While walking he saw another man and asked him to hold the baby. He ran away and the man was startled and went looking for him with the baby. The man walked past the same lady from earlier with the carriage and put the baby in it and left. Then Chaplin happened to be walking right past the carriage the the lady came out and she thought that he put the baby in the carriage again. So, he took the baby back because the police officer showed up. Then he sat down with the baby on a curb and thought about putting it in the sewer. While sitting with the baby he read a note that said the baby was an orphan. Finally, he decided to walk away with the baby.

He picks it up, and when a woman with a carriage passes by, he assumes that she had dropped her baby and offers it to her, which makes her angry and he realizes that she has another baby and that this is not hers. Later, a street officer walks by and appears suspicious, so Chaplin picks up the baby as if it is his and walks along so as to let the officer leave. Chaplin finds an old man walking on a cane and gives him the baby and runs.

He gets hit by some and is frazzled. He grabs a tin from his pocket and grabs a new cigar and lights it with a match from his coat using the bottom of his shoe. He continues walking and finds a baby on the ground next to some trash cans. He looks around confused and picks up the baby. He sees a lady walk by a little ways down the street pushing a stroller. He runs up to her and puts the baby in the stroller saying ""Pardon me, you dropped something"". The lady gets mad and flails and yells at the man as though it's not her child. He begins to franticly take the child back, first mistakenly grabbing her child and then taking the one he gave her. He walked away and tried to put the baby back where he found it but is being watched by an officer and decides to pick the baby back up and continue walking. He then gives the baby to the first person he sees on the street, an old man with a cane. He places the baby in his arms and then runs. The old man tries to chase after him but then doesn't know what to do. The original man runs back to where he found the baby and hides in a shed nearby, again running into the officer so he then tries to walk away casually. The old man now with the baby comes across an unattended stroller with a child in it, the same one the original man had just tried to put the baby in, and leaves the child in there and bolts. The lady comes out of the store to find the strange baby back in her stroller. The original guy happens to be strolling by at this time and out of anger she grabs her closed umbrella and starts beating him. She forces him to take the baby back so he does. He ends up sitting on the curb with the baby in his lap. He is sitting next to a storm drain that he opens, thinking about putting the baby in there but then closes the grate and continues holding the baby. As he is doing so he pricks his finger on something and finds a note attached to the baby's clothes. He opens it up and it reads ""Please love and care for this orphan child"". As he reads this he smiles, puts the note back not he baby, and stands up to happily walk away with the child."

There appears to be some construction going on because there are pieces of rubble flying down from above him. Some of this rubble lands on him, causing him to lose his cigar at which point he stops, takes out another, and lights it, continuing on his way. Suddenly he sees a baby on the ground, alone, all bundled in blankets. He picks up the baby and looks around to see where it may have come from. He sees a lady with a baby of her own, and he asks her if she forgot something. She is very angry with him, indicating that it is clearly not her baby. The first man then sees another man, who he tricks into holding the baby while he ties his shoe, at which point he immediately runs away. Eventually, the first man ends up with the baby again. He sits down on the side of the road and opens up the baby's blankets, finding a note hidden within. The note asks that the finder of the baby take care of this orphan, at which point it appears that he decides to do exactly that.

Chaplin	written_online	9	""	Chaplin is walking along an alleyway and having garbage dropped on his head. He resigns himself to it without protest and lights a cigarette from his tin when he spots a child abandoned in the corner. At first, he glances up, as if to comedically suggest the child was dropped with the trash. Having a conscience but no desire to adopt the child, he attempts to return it to a woman pushing around another infant in a stroller. Unfortunately, she angrily resists this event as the child is not hers. He decides to return the child to the spot where he found it, but a police officer has come up behind him and made it exceedingly awkward to appear to abandon his infant. He ends up passing the kid to a man on the street and running away, but the man somehow manages to deposit the child into the same basket as the woman from before. As Chaplin paces past, she assaults him with an umbrella. To make matters worse for him, the police man returns to the scene, and he is forced to retrieve the displaced infant. Chaplin sits on the edge of the sidewalk, temporarily defeated, and considers dropping the child into the gutter. He shakes his head and checks instead for a note within its blankets that reads, “Please love and care for this orphan child.” An affectionate smile now on his face, Chaplin executes his trademark waddle into the background as the film ends.

He mistakenly thinks that the baby most be hers and puts the baby in the stroller while the mother is in the store. However, when she comes back from the story she becomes very angry and tells him to take the baby back. He does and then tries to return the baby to where he found it. However, he sets the baby down in the sight of a police officer who assumes that the man is abandoning the baby. The man quickly picks the baby up again.

He then lights a cigarette and turns around to find a crying baby by the garbage. He immediately picks up the baby and attempts to place it in the baby carriage of a woman walking by, telling her that she dropped something. The woman is obviously aware that the man had placed the baby in the carriage himself, so she demands that he take the baby. He then tries to put it back where he found it, only to be caught by a police officer. He makes several more attempts to get rid of the baby, but is caught each time.

Clearly, this is not the woman's child, and the woman refuses to take him. Chaplin returns the child to the exact spot where he found him in the alley. Unfortunately for Chaplin, a policeman appears and witnesses him do so. Presumably concerned about the legal consequences of abandoning a child, Chaplin collects the child and leaves the alley.  <br/> While waking, Chaplin comes across an elderly man, and hands the child off to him. The elderly man, uncertain of what is happening, has no time to react as Chaplin flees. The elderly man eventually finds the buggy in which Chaplin originally placed the child. The elderly man places the child in the buggy and leaves without the woman noticing him. Just as the woman notices the second child in her buggy, Chaplin passes by. The woman infers, incorrectly, that Chaplin placed the child in the buggy and confronts him by beating him with an umbrella. While Chaplin and the woman argue, the policeman from earlier reappears, at which point Chaplin desists from arguing and departs with the child.  <br/> Chaplin, sitting with the child, discovers a note attached to the child which reads, ""Please love and take care for this orphan child.""

Upon walking out of the alley he sees a orphaned baby wrapped up in a blanket right next to a dumpster. Chaplin looks for the baby’s parents or possible owner to no avail, so he walks back and forth in search of someone he can give the baby to. When a woman walks into the alleyway with a carriage and a baby of her own, Chaplin waits until she is not paying attention and puts the orphaned baby in the carriage—the woman notices and shoos him and the baby away. Hopeless Chaplin again tries to leave the baby in the alley but is caught red-handed by a police man. Chaplin nonchalantly walks through the streets to escape the police man, and approaches the woman with the carriage again. They get into a fight, broken up by the police officer, and Chaplin walks back to the opening of the alleyway. As he decides where he will leave the baby next, he finds a note that instructs him to take care of the orphaned baby.

As he lights his cigaret and collects himself he notices that there is a baby laying on the ground, crying. Clearly assuming that the baby has a mother or some adult that it belongs to, he begins looking around. He sees a woman pushing a carriage that is holding another child, so presuming that she ""dropped something"" he attempts to give her the baby. She is then visibly infuriated so he takes the baby and attempts to return it to the spot he found it on the ground, only to be found by a police officer. Chaplin then takes the baby and is able to trick a man on the street to hold the baby, as he proceeds to run away in the other direction. That man then places the baby in the same carriage that Chaplin had originally attempted to place it in, as the mother is not present in that moment, he then walks away as well. The mother then returns to her carriage to see the extra baby in it just as Chaplin walks by. She gives the baby to him, he sits down on the curb with the baby and then realizes that there is a note. When he unfolds the note the audience, along with Chaplin, discovers that the baby is an orphan and therefore has no mother to be returned to."

He continues to try to get rid of the baby, each time with no luck. Finally, he finds a note in the baby's blanket saying that he's an orphan and needs to be cared for and loved. Charles smiles and walks off with the baby.

People throw things at him out of windows, but he keeps smoking and strutting down the street mostly unbothered. He stumbles upon a baby in the alley and thinks it belongs to a lady with a stroller passing by. He says “I think you dropped something” and puts the baby in the stroller, but she refuses to take it and indicates the baby is not hers. He tries to put the baby back and a policeman sees him so he picks the baby up again. Then he asks a man with a cane to hold the baby while he ties his shoe and runs away. The man puts the baby in the woman's stroller and walks away. The woman comes out of the store and sees Charlie Chaplin walking by, sees the baby, and beats Carlie with her umbrella and forces him to take the child away. Charlie Chaplin sits on the curb with the baby and briefly considers throwing the baby in the gutter, but decides not to. He finds a piece of paper tucked into the baby’s blanket that says “please love and care for this orphan child”

He continues to walk through the gulley before something else is thrown next to him, again from above. He gets his baccy tin out which is full of cigar butts. He takes out a rollie from the tin and puts it in his mouth. He then gets a match and lights it on the sole of his shoe and uses the match to light his fag. He stars smoking then sees a baby, which he approaches before picking it up. He sees a woman has walked past with a pram so he puts the baby in it and tells her she must've lost something. The pair have an argument before Chaplain ends up having to take the baby back. He goes back to the same place in the gulley that he found the baby and starts to put it back down on the floor whilst a police man comes up behind him. Chaplain sees the police man and ends up having to pick the baby back up. So, he goes round the corner to loose the police man. On the road he pretends to step in some mud and asks an old man with a beard if he'll hold onto the baby for a sec before running away. The old man puts the baby in the same pram as Chaplain had already. The woman gets furious at Chaplain and runs after him with her brolly hitting him constantly til he takes the baby away again. Eventually Chaplain sits down on the curb and opens the grate thinking about throwing the baby down the drain. In the end, he decided that he isn't that mean and instead reaches into the baby's clothes to see that his mother had left a note asking for someone to look after the poor orphan.

After walking further down this alley Chaplin lights a cigarette and finds a baby swaddled in a blanket and abandoned on the street. At first Chaplin tries to get rid of the baby by passing on the responsibility to a mother walking by with a pram and her own child. Unfortunately (for Chaplin), the mother resists and Chaplin returns to the original spot where he found the baby to leave the baby there. While attempting to get rid of the child a cop walks into the scene and Chaplin is forced to pretend he did not just attempt to abandon this child. Next he takes the baby to a main street where he passes the baby off to a stranger while pretending that he needs to tie his shoes, but turns to sprint away instead. This stranger gets rid of the baby by placing it in a nearby pram, which happens to be the same pram/mother as before. The mother eventually sees the new baby and Chaplin who's walking out of the scene. Again Chaplin is forced to take the baby. Chaplin sits down with the baby, considers ditching the baby in the sewer, but then discovers a note that reads something akin to ""please take care and love this orphan.""

We can tell it is a comedic piece right from the start as he walks down the street and bricks fall on him from the sky, and his walking stick is apparently bendy. He also then manages to use his shoe to light his cigarette. The story then takes a turn when we spot an abandoned child lying on the street. Chaplin spots the baby and picks it up in search of it's mother. A woman then walks by with a pram and and Chaplin assumes the baby belongs there and so tries to put the baby in the pram. The woman is shocked and irritated. At a loss Chaplin takes the child and goes to put them back in the alleyway, but just at that moment is halted by a policeman. In order to avoid getting into trouble Chaplin picks the baby back up and walks around the street to dump the child in another man's arms, running away. The man spots the very same woman that Chaplin had tried to leave the baby with before and he successfully leaves the child in the pram while the woman is inside a shop. Just as the woman exits the shop and spots the child in the pram again Chaplin walks past. He then gets in trouble with the woman again and is forced to take the child back out of the pram. At a loss he sits down on the curb with the child and finds a slip of paper in the baby's wrappings. The note states the child is an orphan and to please love and care for them. Chaplin has a change of heart and is last seen walking away with the child smiling.

He then happens upon an elderly man who he dupes into taking the baby by pretending to tie his shoelaces before running off. The elderly man, after failing to catch up with Charlie, then also finds the pram and puts the baby in it before walking off. Charlie walks down the street carefree past the pram only to be seen by the mother who angrily chases him down the street and hits him with an umbrella, thinking he has attempted to once again pass the burden of the baby onto her. The policeman gets involved so Charlie, defeated, takes the baby once more and sits on the street curb by a drain. He momentarily considers putting the baby in the drain and leaving however discovers a note in the baby's clothes begging for its finder to look after it, for it is an orphan. Taken aback, Charlie decides to keep the baby and walks off with it off camera, with uplifting music beginning to play in the background.

He looks down, and sees next to a dustbin, an abandoned baby. He picks it up and tries to place it in a parked pram. The owner of the pram, however, catches him in the act. Charlie has to take his newfound orphan and try and give it to someone else. He walks down an alleyway and passes the baby to an old man with a walking stick. Charlies character pretends to do his laces and then runs away and hides. The old man then places the baby, after some time, back into the pram we saw from earlier. The old women leaves the shop where the pram is parked outside to see an extra baby in the pram. As she does this, Charlies character is skipping past.

He was certainly bothered by the trash thrown at him. But, even more, he didn't know what to do with the baby. In a humorous and lighthearted clip Chaplin searched for an inconspicuous place to leave the baby and even attempted to place it in another baby's stroller. Near the end of the clip Chaplin bounces between two extremes, throwing the baby down the sewer and actually feeling sympathy for the child. This change of heart came after Chaplin found a letter in the baby's blanket asking for him to care for the orphan child. In the end, Chaplin appeared to have a ""normal"" human reaction and accept responsibility to care for the baby at least temporarily."

As he was putting down the baby, a police officer walked by and gave the man an angry look, causing the man to pick up the baby and act like nothing was going on. Out of ideas, the man walked throughout the streets trying to think of what to do with the baby until he came across a man who was walking alone. He politely asked the man to hold the baby while he tied his shoes, and then suddenly sprinted off so that the other man was stuck with the baby now. The other man also happened to cross paths with the mother with the stroller and he also placed the abandoned baby into the stroller and walked off. The mother once again looked angered by this and coincidentally saw the original man walking by and gave the abandoned baby to him. He then took the baby and walked off and saw down on the curb looking defeated. While sitting there with the baby in his arms he found a note within the blankets wrapped around the baby. It said to take care of the orphan baby. The man looked sad yet hopeful for a better future for the baby. The end.

Then he stops, takes a cigarette out of a box from his inside coat pocket, takes off his gloves, strikes a match on the heel of his shoe, and lights the cigarette. He throws his gloves into the trash can beside him. Then he notices a baby wrapped in a blanket lying on the ground against the brick wall of the alley he's in. He glances closer at the baby, looks up around him as if to see whether anyone at a window nearby might be looking for a baby, and finally picks up the baby, just as a woman with a perambulator comes into the alley. He spots her and tries to hail her, but she parks the perambulator and slips away somewhere between a staircase and a wall. The man carries the baby toward the perambulator and puts the baby into it just as the woman comes back. He thinks he's returned the baby to where it came from, but the woman shouts at him, indicating that he's wrong. There's already another infant in the perambulator. The man takes the baby out again and hurries away with it. He makes to put the baby back where he found it, but then he realizes a policeman is watching him, so he picks the baby back up and walks off. He goes around the corner, sees a man walking down the street, and puts the baby in his arms. He pretends to tie his shoelace, as if that was why he needed someone to hold the baby, but then he bolts, leaving the second man with the baby. The second man walks off in a hurry, sees the same perambulator as before left outside an open doorway, and deposits the baby in it. Meanwhile, the first man has hidden in a building back in the alley. When he comes out, he comes face to face with the policeman again and hurries off. Meanwhile, the woman has emerged from the shop and finds the second baby in her perambulator again. Just then, the first man walks by, and she, believing he's put the baby in her perambulator again, chases after him, knocks him down by hitting him on the head with her umbrella, and then beats him about the head with the umbrella, dragging him back to the perambulator. She points at the baby, insisting he take it back. The policeman arrives to see what the commotion is all about, and the man, not wanting to get in trouble, takes the baby and goes off again. He drops his cane in the gutter and sits down on the curb to retrieve it. He remains seated, though, lifts the grate of the storm sewer, and considers throwing the baby in for a moment before closing the grate. Then he sticks his hand into the blanket the baby is wrapped in and finds a note that reads, ""Please love and care for this orphan child."" He seems to feel a sudden tenderness for the baby.

As one of the people dropped their trash right on top of him basically, his cigar was knocked out of his hand. He stepped away and then begun digging in his tobacco tin to find another one to smoke, having to sift through 4 or 5 half smoked cigars he had left in there. He removed his gloves to light it, and for some reason decided to trash the gloves afterward.

He ran over to her and tried to leave the baby he found in the carriage with the baby already in it, however the woman rushed up to him and began shooing him away as it was not her baby. Mr. Chaplin then thought he'd go put the baby back where he found it, but a police officer happened to wander by and give him a stare as if to say ""what the hell are you doing leaving a baby there!?"" So Mr. Chaplin quickly picked the baby back up and started retracing his steps to see if he could find the baby's parents or someone more suited to take care of the baby. He found a not so clean elderly man in a suit with a cane and handed him the baby, then took off running. Ironically the man he gave the baby too, discovered the woman with the carriage from before and left the baby in the carriage as Mr. Chaplin had done before. Mr. Chaplin then happened to run into the police officer again and began walking quickly in the other direction, which happened to be just beyond the woman and the carriage. As the woman turned each direction to try and find whoever had left the baby in her carriage again, she spotted Mr. Chaplin and chased him down, knocking him to the ground and then pummeling him with her umbrella, as she was under the impression it was Mr. Chaplin who had tried to sneak the baby into her carriage for a second time. She demanded he take the baby back when the police officer wanders by again. Mr. Chaplin, afraid he would be in trouble, took the baby back and walked away from both the woman and police officer. He found a curb to sit on near a storm drain. He looked at the storm drain, then back at the baby, then back at the storm drain, thinking to himself... ""what if..."" However, his better senses prevailed and he looked at the baby thinking, ""I could never do that to you!"" He then found a note in the rags covering the baby that read, ""Please love and care for this orphan child.""

A few feet further, he saw a baby laying on the ground, wrapped up, by himself. He picked the baby up and looked for the caretaker, but no one was around. Then, a mother with a carriage, already carrying one baby, passed by, so he immediately assumed it must be hers and dropped the abandoned baby in the carriage. She freaked out, and took the baby out. He tried to give the baby up a few more times, but in the end, he decided to keep it and care for it as he found a note saying to do so for the orphan child.

Chaplin	written_online	5	""	Charlie Chaplin, with a cane and cigar, walks by a home while someone is sweeping debris out of the window.  He moves to avoid getting hit.  Ge adjusts his hat, bends his cane, and is hit by debris from a different angle.  He looks around to see from where the material came and then takes his cigarette holder out of his pocket.  He rummages around in the tin before taking out a cigarette, tapping it on the closed tin, and placing it in his mouth.   He finds his matches in his pocket but removes his gloves before striking one on the sole of his shoe.  He then throws the match in a trash can, followed by his gloves.  He looks down and sees a crying baby wrapped in a blanket.  He inspects the baby, looks up at the buildings, and picks the baby up at the same time a woman turns the corner with a pram carrying a small child.  He runs after the woman and places the baby in the pram with her child when she steps away.  She returns and tells him that it is not her baby and she leaves with the pram and child.  Chaplin remains holding the infant.  He places the baby back on the ground where it was found just as a police officer appears behind him.  When Chaplin turns and sees the officer, he picks the baby up again and walks away.  He sees an old man and stops beside him, handing him the baby and pretending to fix his shoe.  He then runs away and the old man, stuck with the baby, follows.  He hides in a shed and the old man places the baby in the woman's pram with her older child as she has once again stepped away.  Chaplin leaves the shed and attempts to go back the way he came but runs into the officer again.  He turns around and makes his way to the street, passing the pram as the woman notices she has the baby.  She chases after him and beats him with her umbrella before dragging him back to the pram.  While arguing about the infant, the police officer arrives and Chaplin takes the baby and returns to the alley with the homes.  The woman with the pram leaves and the officer remains on the sidewalk.  Chaplin drops his cane and sits down on the curb to pick it up.  It is here that he notices the storm drain and raises the grate, looks at the baby, and closes the grate once again.  He finds a slip of paper, attached to the blanket wrapped around the baby, which says to love and care for the orphan.  He then cradles the baby, picks up his cane, and walks away with a smile.

He looks for a new one from a small case in his pocket. He takes off his gloves and throws them in a trashcan on the side of the alley. Suddenly, he sees a baby wrapped in blankets laying near the trash cans. He picks up the baby and, wanting to get rid of it, places it in the baby carriage of a woman nearby. She rejects him, and he tries to put the baby back in the alley, but a police man stops him from leaving the baby there. He then tries to pass the baby off to another man walking down the street, and this man tries the same trick of dropping off the baby in the woman's baby carriage. The second man runs away, and the woman blames Charlie, giving the baby back to him. At the end, Charlie sits with the baby on the curb, and finds a note that says the baby is an orphan, and leaves the last scene carrying the baby.
