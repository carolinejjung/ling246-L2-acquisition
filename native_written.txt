It wasn't the women's baby and so he had to take it back. He then tried to put the baby back where he found it but then a police officer showed up so he picked up the baby and kept walking. While walking he saw another man and asked him to hold the baby. He ran away and the man was startled and went looking for him with the baby. The man walked past the same lady from earlier with the carriage and put the baby in it and left. Then Chaplin happened to be walking right past the carriage the the lady came out and she thought that he put the baby in the carriage again.

This video was about a man who found a orphaned baby next to the dumpster and did not understand what that meant. He Saw a woman with a large stroller and presumed that she had forgotten the baby. This shows that he may not have been able to pick up the social cues. The woman however, upon placement of the orphaned child in her stroller she was upset because she did not want to have to care for another baby. Thus, the man put the baby back where he found it, however, due to his poor luck there was a police man right behind him so man couldn't just place the babe back where he found it and therefore he gave the baby off to someone else. But that man did not want the baby and so the man was stuck with the orphaned baby. He finally sat down to contemplate the other options that he had and realized there was a note in the clothes of the baby. The note read "please love and care for this orphaned baby." And he went off to do just that (it is assumed).
