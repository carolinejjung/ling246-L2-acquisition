ok so in the video there is a man at the beginning and he walks around pretty carelessly he is walking through a construction zone / and kinda looks like somebody that just doesn't have a clue / uh so he gets hit / by some like scaffolding or something that falls / uh and then / he decides the solution to that is to smoke a cigarette so he goes for that and then he sees a baby / uh that just left in the street and he picks the baby up / uh has it then kinda decides / oo i don't know if this is a good idea so starts looking around sees a stroller thinks maybe / the mom accidentally somehow drop the baby out the stroller so he puts the baby in the stroller / uh the woman comes out of the store the owner of the stroller / and it's not her baby so she freaks out she makes the man take the baby hhh back he grabs her own baby at first and then / grabs the right one / uh so then he goes back just to put the baby back down on the street and a police officer comes so now he is dodging a mom and a police officer so as he picks the baby up uh then he tricks another guy into holding the baby / uh and runs away / uh thinking that he is rid of the baby / and uh I am pretty sure he encounters the police officer again after that and the guy who he's tricked uh puts the baby back in the same stroller / uh of the same mother from before / uh while she is in a different store / so then the original guy that had the baby is just walking about on the street / and uh the mom comes out thinks he's put / the baby in her stroller once again and she just starts / going to town beating him with this umbrella thing / and then he goes to pick the baby back up again the mom calls the police officer from before over / uh to settle the dispute / and so the guy just realizes that he's stuck with this baby uh so he walks with the baby for a little bit / he sits down on the street and for a split second / he is tempted to put the baby uh in the sewer hhh I don't know I but yeah so he is tempted for that but then he finds a note on the baby that says / uh please love and care for this orphan child and / in that moment everything changes like he sees the baby / in a totally different way has a complete change of heart and decides to keep the baby / and so that is the end
so first / uh Chaplin was walking and getting ready to smoke / when / he saw a baby in the alleyway / the police officer / uh actually he saw a woman uh walking around with a stroller and / he figured it was hers so he walked up to her and the woman / said it wasn't hers after he put it in the carriage and eventually took it back / then he was walking back to put the baby in the alley where he found it but the police officer came by 'nâ€™ he decided that wasn't a good idea / so he walked away with the baby / and then he saw a man walking around 'n' asked the man to hold the baby while he tied his shoe / and / the man uh took the baby and he pretended to tie his shoe and then ran off / uh that made the man very angry so he went to go look for Chaplin / uh while Chaplin was walking away / uh / hhh he ran into the police officer without the baby / but then just decided to walk away while the police officer had no idea what was going on / the man went to go look for Chaplin and eventually found the carriage that we saw from earlier / and put the baby in there and then walked off / uh Chaplin was then walking and eventually walked past the same carriage again but then / the lady came out and figured that he put the baby back in there / and / so he took the baby back uh the police officer came / and he just walked away with the baby / then the / Chaplin was walking / and walked past a curb / 'n' decided to sit down / and even thought about putting the baby in hhh the sewer / but / found a note inside the baby's blanket that said to take him / take care 'n' love the baby / and hhh he found it very heartwarming and so he walked away 'n' probably did that
uh there is a man walking through the street and he stops to smoke a cigarette when he finds a baby on the ground beside him / and he picks up this baby and intents to find the mother and he finds a woman with a baby stroller puts the baby inside and the woman stops him because it is not her baby she already has a baby in the stroller / uh so he picks the baby back up and walks around with it and then decides to leave it in the exact spot on the ground where he had found the baby / uh but then the police man sees him do this / and he picks up the baby again and has to go find someone else to give it to / uh and so he finds an older man with a cane walking through the street with a bit and gives the baby to him / uh and runs away from him / and this other man goes and puts the baby in the exact same baby stroller as the first man did / and when the woman leaves / the store that she's in she sees this other baby in the stroller and is very upset / so / and then the first man walks by the carriage at this point / uh and the woman catches him and is yelling at him and / the police come / and eventually this first man takes the baby again / and he walks with the baby a little bit more and then sits down on the curb / uh where he is thinking and it looks like he wants to put the baby in the the sewer drain underneath the street but then / doesn't and he finds a note in the baby's blanket that says uh please care for 'n' love my orphan child / and / he thinks a little bit more and he gets up and leaves and it appears that he does intent to take care of this child /
ok so the video starts off with a guy / who is walking around and / he almost gets hit by a ton of bricks and then / after that he goes for a smoke and after he starts smoking he starts walking a little and he finds a baby / uh on the ground wrapped up in blankets so then he picks the baby up 'n' / starts looking around to see if there's someone who / forgot the baby or something and / he / sees a woman with a baby carriage wa= walk by / and so he goes over there and sets the baby in the baby carriage / with / the woman's other baby / but then she comes out and she / he realizes it's not hers and she gets mad / so he takes the baby again and / starts walking away / then he starts looking for another place to / put the baby and / the police start suspecting something so they start following him around / and the man / is walking and sees another man and / hands the baby to him and runs away / and then the police find him again so he / kind of just runs off again / and after that / uh the other man puts the baby in the same carriage / and the woman thought it was the first man who did it so she starts running after him / and so he takes the baby again and / decides to go sit down with the baby / and he opens up the blankets and finds a little note with the baby that says that the child is an orphan and he decides to keep the baby
ok so / this / is / a video / of / Charlie Chaplin and / he / is might just be at the wrong place / at the wrong time every single time / he / is walking / and he / comes across this baby and a blanket by the dumpster / and / for us / I guess we would assume that it's just an orphan child or someone left the baby / uh but the title of the video is awkward as so I guess he / really didn't pick up that social cue / so / as he comes across the baby he picks it up / and / he sees that / a woman has come by with her carriage and seems to have a space for two babies / so he's like oh this lady has lost her baby and so he puts the baby in the cart and the lady / gets angry because clearly it's not her baby / and she gets mad at him so he takes the baby out / and he / wants to put it back where he found it cause clearly that was not the wrong spot / and then a police man shows up / and / the police man / is / watching over / Charlie / and Charlie realizes that he can't just / leave the baby / where / he found it / and so / then he picks up the baby because / now he is in charge of this baby that he's found / and he / obviously doesn't want the baby because he walks around / uh in a hurry trying to figure out what to do with it and so he sees a man / and he tricks the man / into taking the baby / and so as the man has the baby he comes across the same woman with the baby carriage that seems to have a space for two babies / and the man / puts the baby in the baby carriage / but / as he walks away / Charlie then comes by and the lady recognizes Charlie as the one who originally put the baby in the baby carriage / and so / the lady / then spots Charlie / walking and / she again gets mad at him / and so / the police man then comes by once again / at the wrong time / and Charlie seems to be there at the wrong place at the wrong time and the police man watches over and so / Charlie once again has to take the baby / and so / now he feels like he's all out of options so / he / sits down on the curb side / and / sees that there's a note with the baby / and it says / please care for this orphan child / so / it seems as though / once he saw this note / that said the child was an orphan child / he flipped the switch and was like oh this child has nobody I must care for it / whereas before / the child / just seemed to be lost / and so he had to care for this / find a home for this lost baby / but / it turns out it's an orphan child but what's interesting is that the police man / wasn't really doing anything he was just standing / and watching and / not making an efford to / find the owner or a home for this baby it was all up to Charlie Chaplin so / the video ends and we don't know / what happens / after / but it appears that / Charlie must care for this baby / I wonder if there's a sequel
first of all the guy goes and he's just walking around on this area with a building and / uh then he something drops from the building and / he's keeps walking on / and / he / uh eventually light his cigar / uh from his foot I think uh and then / he all of the sudden the / scene changes a little bit when he like / uh knows where he is he's all settle and then all of the sudden he sees a baby / uh and then he goes and picks it up / uh and this woman / uh came by while her stroller was in the area that he was in and so uh he eventually put the baby in the stroller / and uh started walking away the woman caught him / and so he realizes he did something wrong and so he took the baby / uh out of the stroller and / uh put the baby back / uh and then / uh / the police man came by and the original man thought / it was wrong so he pick the baby back up / uh / then the police man left / then the guy the next guy with a beard / came by and / uh / was just / strolling along and then / the original dude uh / took and gave the baby to the guy / and / and then he's starting walking away with the baby / the guy with the bearded / and then he put it in the stroller / uh which is like in a new scene / uh so then the / uh baby was in the stroller / with the woman / and / the bear= the guy with the beard left and uh / and then / all of the sudden the original guy / uh came by / just so happen that it he was walking by the woman again with the stroller / uh the woman got mad at him and so he took the baby / so now he has the baby back / uh / and then / the police man watched that whole scene / uh half way through I think / uh / and so he was frustrated the original guy was frustrated / and he's starting walking along the street with the baby he dropped his cane / and then he sat down and just / started looking at the baby more intensively and then / there is a piece of paper written in it uh said take care and love this orphan child / and I think that kind of soften his heart to where he / uh / wanted to take care of this child so / after all that he uh / started to bring a smile to his face there is more light to his uh emotions and interactions and I think / uh / after he saw / or after / everything was done he was more happy / with / the / whole situation and why he got placed with the baby
so in the video / uh Charlie is walking through the alley and people throwing trush out of the window and it hits him / uh and then decides he's gonna smoke a cigar and while he's standing in this alley smoking his cigar sees a baby on the ground / so he picks up the baby doesn't know who belongs to and all of the sudden a lady in a stroller walks by / and he just assumes oh must be this lady's baby so goes and puts / the baby he found in the alley in this lady's stroller and she comes out and gets mad at him because it's not her baby / so then walks back to / the alley he was in before and tries to set the baby d= back down on the ground / when a police officer sees Charlie doing this obviously and it looks like Charlie is trying to get rid of his own baby / and so then he asks to keep it / and so then he's wondering what to do / and uh he sees a man and / gives the man the baby and runs away / the man can't find Charlie cause Charlie is hidding in the alley / and so the man walks down on to a main street and sees an empty stroller belonging to the lady that Charlie had already tried to give the baby to / and he puts the baby in the stroller and the lady comes out and sees the baby / unfortunately Charlie walks out onto the street and the lady sees Charlie and assumes that he put the baby in her stroller again and she starts beating him with an umbrella / called the police man over / and so Charlie has to take the baby / and so then Charlie finally takes the baby and he goes to sits down on the curb / thinks about putting the baby down to the sewer drain / then he looks in the baby's blankets and sees a note / uh that addresses how the baby is an orphan child / so Charlie kinda reads it and then walks off with the baby
so in the / Charlie Chaplin video I just watched / he's walking down the street / minding his own business and / after a little bit of comic uh xxx out of him getting almost hit with bricks and lightning a cigar / he stumbles upon uh a baby / uh that just sitting on the ground / and at first he tries to he's not really sure what to do and then he tries to give it to a woman / and then the woman like catches him / trying to give the baby away and she's like no you take it back / so then he's kind of stuck / looking around he's not really sure what to do / and he's about to leave the baby uh pretty much back where he found it / and then a police officer walks by and almost catches him / xxx this child and obviously / not knowing the context the woman or the police officer / uh it looks pretty bad for Charlie so / Charlie ends up taking the baby and starts walking around try to find another place / uh to / or someone else to give the baby to / and he ends up finds this random man on the street / and he just give the baby the random man and runs away and the mans' like what do I do / so he ends up / funny enough finding the same woman that Charlie tried to give the baby to earlier and puts it in / her baby carriage / that are her ones in and walks away / and then by ten seconds later Charlie walks by and the woman notices Charlie walking by / and he looks at her / uh ca= baby carriage and she sees that oh there's the same baby as before so she gives him like a whaking with her umbrella / and afterwards ends up making him taking the baby again / then eventually hhh uh /  Charlie after some more / uh small / incident Charlie ends up sitting down with the baby kind of frustrated not sure what to do / so sits down with the baby and / peeks into a drain well or manhole and / maybe for a brief moment considers putting the baby down there / after some bare judgment better thinking he decides not to and holds the baby and then he ends up finding a small note that says please love this orphan child / and at the end of the video Charlie ends up keeping the baby /
uh in the video Charlie Chaplin was walking down in the alley when he finds a baby / he picks up the baby and tries to give it to a woman who also has another baby / uh she doesn't let him and so he takes it back / he walks back down the alley and tries to put the baby back down where he found it / uh then a police officer comes down and so he has to pick up / back up the baby and continue on / he then tries to give the baby to an older man / uh the man ends up putting the baby / in the crib of the woman who Charlie Chaplin had originally tried to give the baby to / so when Charlie walked by the woman again she stopped him and had him take the baby back / uh Charlie Chaplin then walks and sat down on a curb / and found a note inside the babys' blanket / that said please love and care for this orphan child / and after that he kept the baby
the video starts off with Charles Chaplin walking through the steets and is somehow being hit with some sort of debris or whatever it is people are throwing out of their windows / uh and then he finds a baby / uh laying next to the garbage and so he picks up the baby and tries to / uh / kinda get rid of it / and so he / he put places it in / uh the baby carriage of another woman / claiming that she dropped the baby / and then hhh / they bicker and argue for a little bit and then he / takes the baby / and then / tries to put it back towards the garbage hhh / but is then caught by a police officer and so then he picks it back up / and then makes all over it / several other attempts to get rid of it uh including / asking another man to hold the baby while he runs off / uh but gets caught then / and then he / finds the / woman he uh encountered before tries to place it in her baby carriage once again but is then hhh / caught by her and then the police officer / uh and so he / tries to make several other attempts to get rid of the baby it's clear that he doesn't want it / uh but doesn't wanna put it and he doesn't want the responsibility of it / and so he then / sits on the side of the street / to try to think about / uh what to do with it next and it's obvious that he contemplates dropping it down the sewers' drain / uh but then finds a uh note enclosed in uh the babys' blanket / that asks to please take care of the baby and / cause it's an orphan / and so then he uh / he's attitude obviou= immediately changes and he decides to take care of the baby / and hhh / the clip ends with the two of them / walking off
ok so the video starts with Charlie Chaplin walking down the street / uh / and it's like an alleyway and then / on the ground he finds a child / uh just a baby laying in a xxx and xxx / uh so then Charlie picks up the baby and walks / with it tryin' to find who it belongs to / he sees a woman with a stroller uh with another child in it and / he assumes it's hers and he puts the child inside the stroller with the other one / uh / and then / the woman / realizes and says it's not hers and / makes him take it back / uh so then Charlie walks back towards where he finds the baby and tries to just put it where he found it / and a police officer / sees him / supposedly abandoning the baby / so uh obviously that's not good and Charlie then / takes it and walks away with the baby again / he then gives it to a random man walking down the street and / runs away so that the man now is stuck with the baby / and the man does the same thing as Charlie and puts it into the stroller of the woman / with the other child / uh then Charlie walks down the street pass the woman and / she realizes it's him and she / goes and hits him and makes him take the child back again / uh / he is then stuck with the child again and then just kinda walks with it not sure what to do / he sits down on a curb with the baby / and finds a note  with it / that says please love and care for this orphan child / and at the end uh / Charlie / has the baby and kinda smiles / acting like he may take care of the baby / and that's where it ends with him walking away holding the baby
ok so Charlie Chaplin was kinda walking along and minding his own business and trying to light his cigarette / and then he found a baby laying on the ground / and he wasn't really sure what to do with it so he picked it up / and just then he saw a lady walking by with a stroller so he thought that it was her baby so he went to go / put the baby uh in her stroller and he said pardon me you dropped something to her hhh / uh and she got very angry cause it wasn't her baby and then tried to take the wrong baby / but eventually then he ended up again / with this right baby that he found on the ground / so then he kinda seems to decide that it's just too much trouble so he goes to try and put the baby back on the ground where he found it / but just then a police man is walking by and obviously gets mad because you can't just leave babies on the ground / and so he made Charlie pick the baby back up and so he did / uh so then he was getting alot angry wanted to get rid of the baby / so he saw an old man walking around / and he asked him to hold the baby for a second so he can tie his shoes and then he pretended for a second to tie his shoes and run away so the old man was stuck with the baby / uh but this old man didn't want the baby either so he saw a lady walking along with a stroller which happen to be the same lady from before / he put the baby in her stroller and run away / uh and then the lady came out saw the baby in her stroller / thought it was Charlie because he is was the one who had put that same baby in her stroller before and sees Charlie walking and so she goes over / and sort of attacks him with her umbrella / makes him take the baby back the police man from before comes over and they all make Charlie take the baby / uh so Charlie is feeling pretty sad and he has holding this baby walking alone and he sits now on a curb / and he sees the sewer drain and he sort of opens it looks at it looks at the baby / uh is thinking about dropping the baby down but doesn't quite drop the baby yet / and then he finds a note in the baby's uh blankets that are wrapped around it and the note says / uh that please love and care for this orphan child / and so Charlie decides then to keep the baby / and he kinda walks off smiling with the baby and the music is a lot of happier / and that's the end
the story begins with a man / walking down the street / suddenly he is hit by some garbage from above / he calls the man / rubbish / next / he decides to light a cigarette in the alley / however he sees a baby / that is crying in the str= in the alley / he looks around to see if it is anybody's baby / and sees a mother / walking with a stroller / he decides to go over to the mother and / put the baby he puts the baby in the stroller / the mother / angrily says that the baby is not hers / and demands he takes the baby / he walks back to the alley  / and / thinks about leaving the baby / laying in the alley / however a policeman shows up / and / demands that he keeps the baby / the man walks out and sees an old man / he / gets the old man to / hold the baby while he / pretends to tie his shoes / he quickly runs away / and / with the old man following him / the old man sees the stroller / that is a p= / that was appeared earlier in the video / and puts the baby in the stroller / and and leaves / then / the first man walks by the s= the stroller a little bit later / and the mother sees him that he had left the baby in the stroller / and hits him and demands he takes the baby / man goes back to the original alley / he he sits down on the curb and sees a sewer system / he thinks about putting the se= the baby in the sewer system / he and but decides against it / next he finds a note on the baby that says please love and care for this orphan child / the end
ok so at the beggining of the film or a short clip / Charlie Chaplin is walking through the alleyway through the street and all of the sudden seems like / a tone of bricks are falling of the building and are about to hit him but they don't / uh / so he looks around doesn't know where they came from / uh so / next he / strikes a match on his shoe on the heel of his shoe uh to light his cigarette / or a cigar uh / has a smoke / and then / some randomly / he throws away his gloves / uh he looks down / to his left and there is a baby laying there in the alley / uh looks around doesn't see anybody / that looks to be his parents / her parents / uh / and so he picks up the baby / stands up turns around and there's a woman / with her own child in a pram uh / strollering the baby down the road she walks into a building on the right leaves the baby outside in the stroller / uh and so Charlie walks up puts that baby in the pram thinking that it's hers and she just somehow left it on the street / uh and as he's about to walk away the woman comes out realizes that / there's another baby in her stroller / with her child / uh so she orders Charlie Chaplin to take the baby that he put in there back / uh so Charlie takes it back is walking back to the alley and he's going to put it down / and a police man walks up / so he decides to reverse his decision / picks up the baby is walking down the street clearly not wanting to get into trouble with the police / uh and he finds an old man gives the baby to the old man / uh / and then walks away / Charlie Chaplin walks away the old man takes the baby is walking down the street / sees the / lady with this stroller the same woman that Charlie had already put the / baby in / uh / he puts the child in the stroller / because the woman was inside a store or something like that / uh and he walks away the old man walks away / during this time Charlie was hiding from the police the police finds him so Charlie rapidly walks away / uh is walking past the stroller / that / he had put the baby in the old man the old man had put the baby in / and the woman walks out / sees that the baby is there again sees Charlie assumes that Charlie put the baby in the stroller / so she runs after him and beats him over the head with an umbrella Charlie takes the baby because the police man's / clearly staying right there / takes the baby / walks away / uh / and is walking down the street sits on the sidewalk on a curb / uh finds a gate / like a sewer gate sewers' gate / lifts it up / appears to be debating whether or not he's going to put / the baby down the / gate or down the sewer / decides against it close the gate / he's looking through the babys' uh clothes his blankets / he sees that there's a note so he opens the note / uh / and the note says / please love and care for this orphan child or something along those lines uh / Charlie Chaplin clearly touched by the note decides to / keep the baby or of what we can tell is keeping the baby so he stands up / and he walks away
this xxx film starts with a man walking in a rather / dirty part of a city / uh / and eventually he finds a baby on the ground / he is confused when he finds the baby and looks around and sees a woman with a carriage and another baby / and assumes that that is also / that the baby also belongs to her / so he brings the baby over to the woman hhh and puts in her carriage / hhh she's quite frustrated and annoyed and shows that that's not her baby and instead he takes it back / he takes the baby back and is starting to put the baby back where he found it when a police officer also walks by / hhh to not get in trouble he brings picks the back up and walks away he then attempts to get rid of the baby again by tricking an old man to hold the baby while he is seemingly tying his shoe but rather he runs away / hhh the old ba= uh the old man tries to run after him / but then also sees a woman with a carriage and a baby the same woman from before hhh and puts the baby in that carriage / then the man from the beginning of the film is walking b/ and the woman recognize him and sees that there's the same baby in her carriage again and runs after him and hits him with an umbrella / and the police officer that also saw / the man trying to put the baby back / comes by and the woman tells the police officer that this man is take the baby and that he's trying to give her the baby that's not hers hhh so then the man takes the baby and walks around again he considers putting the baby in a xxx drain but then finds a note on the baby asking for someone to please take care and love for the baby hhh and eventually he decides to keep / the baby he found
wonderful hhh uh ok so uh it was immediately easy to tell that it was going to be a comedy piece uh xxx by Charlie Chaplin uh xxx is quite well-known uh hhh and it was immediately noticeable that it was going to be comedy piece because uh the walking stick he was using was bended rather than doing the job it should and a bricks xxx on him hhh uh and then the main story xxx happens which he finds a a child a baby on the floor as it's clearly been abandoned uh hhh so / he picks it up xxx he doesn't want it uh and then tries to xxx it back but uh / I think a police officer comes along and say that's xxx uh I think that's also a woman that comes along uh with a buggy and uh he then tries to put it in that instead uh but the woman immediately notices and puts a stop to that as well so that's the common thing anytime he tries to get rid of the baby something happens to stop that hhh uh and then / he tries to dump it off and hhh to the arms of another man uh and then the man tries to put it in the same buggy that uh the woman was struggling with uh but the woman notices again and then the character of Charlie Chaplin walks passed and she thinks that it was him that uh had put the baby back in the buggy again uh / and then she tries to attack him with uh I think it was an umbrella uh and then uh what happened next hhh uh I think the police officer came back again uh to try stopping again uh and eventually uh Charlie Chaplin kind of gives up and uh xxx and uh he's holding the baby and then he finds a little note inside of the of the wrappings that's the baby's in uh and it says uh this xxx cub this orphan child or something like that uh and then he's quite happy and then he changes his mind realizes he actually wants to xxx and then walks xxx so very happy ending hhh
uh so the video / Charlie Chaplin started / uh when he was walking down an alleyway / some dirt comes from overhead / and kind of falls on him and he's upset about it / and then he keeps walking and stops xxx / uh lights his cigarette or I guess a cigar / and then uh / he's kind of smoking in and he looks around and sees a / a baby lying along on the on the ground / and / he takes a look around to see if anybody / I guess accidentally puts the baby on the ground for some reason / and then / uh picks up the baby / uh / and he's holding it 'n' 'n' walking back and forth and then he sees a woman and a carriage and he assumes that the baby must probably be / hers / so he goes and he / puts the baby / in the carriage while the woman is in another building / uh / and then when the woman comes out he says I think you've I think you've uh misplaced something hhh and / even though they don't say anything it's clear that the / woman is / telling him no that's not my baby and / the other baby is my baby but this baby is not my baby so / take it and get out of here / uh / so then / he almost takes the wrong baby but then uh she seems to point him that no that's not my baby the other one / uh / oh no that is my baby take the other baby xxx the other baby / he goes back to where he found the baby / and he puts it down / but a police officer is watching and then when he sees that the police officer is watching and he picks the baby back up / and he starts / walking away / uh / and he's hold= he's xxx then holding the baby and then / he sees / another man an older man walking with a cane / and he places the baby in the man's arms and then he just / runs / away as quickly as he can / but the man with the cane is really surprise and start following him but Charlie Chaplin / hides uh inside the building so the man doesn't see him / and then this second man sees the same / baby carriage as before / and does the same thing Charlie Chaplin did and put the baby / in / the baby carriage / uh / and walks away / and / as soon as Charlie Chaplin has really xxx the man has gone he starts walking away too / but at that / same moment the woman / of the baby carriage comes out of a= another building / and / sees / that this same bay is in her carriage again and sees Charlie Chaplin beginning to walk by and xxx uh runs over to him and hits him on the head with her / uh with her umbrella / and then uh / brings brings him over and places the baby in his arms and then / walks away with the carriage / so now Charlie Chaplin has the baby again / uh so then he walks over / to the other side of the street / and he sits / beside / what looks like a like a sewer / and he's holding xxx looks at the sewer grate and he's he looks at the sewer grate and looks at the baby and he's probably thinking about maybe putting the baby in sewer but then / he doesn't because xxx and then he's holding the baby / and then he notices that there's a note and takes up the note and reads it and the note says / please care for this orphan child please love and care for this orphan child hhh and / that / seems to really change his mind and he smiles at the baby and kind of talks to it a little bit / and then uh gets back up and then he's holding the baby and walks away so / one can assume that xxx keep the baby
