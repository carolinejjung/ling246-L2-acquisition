Ok this story is about toch uh Charles Chaplin get in touch with the baby and it starts when he walks down a shabby side road / and people uh threw their trash out of the window and / he was hit by some trash and then he um put on a new cigarette / and he heard a baby screaming and he looked down on the ground where the baby lies / and he picks it up / and uh / when he looks at the baby behind him there’s a woman / uh  carrying a ba=baggy with the baby in it and he uh / turns around and decides that maybe she uh / is the mother of the baby or he could just put it / into it and uh / when he does uh the uh woman cam=came back and si uh told him that it’s not hers and he should pick it up again / then he picks it up and wants to put it back on the ground / and uh / while he does that a police officer’s coming / uh right behind him and looks very / uh strict and uh Charlie Chaplan decides to pick the baby up again and walks away / and he uh / meets an elderly man xxx walking stock and asked him to hold the baby for a moment and uh / the man said yes and then Charlie Chaplin walks away and uh the old man walks / with the baby / along the street and finds the baggy from the woman before / and / he decides to put in the baby and walks away as well and then the woman came back from a shop / and uh she finds the additional baby / and is mad and that happened when Charlie Chaplin crosses her way and she / follows him with her umbrella and is really uh angry / and they start to fight / over the baby and there uh huge discussion when the policemen from before / arrives and Charlie Chapman decides to avoid any more trouble that he picks the baby up again / and / then he walks back to the street sit down and uh other things uh options where he could pick the bae uh put the baby and he decide to uh / look in the hole / but then he uh hhh he decides to take a closer look at the baby and he finds uh / a piece of paper where it said that / eh whoever finds the baby should uh take care of it and love this orphan child and then he decides to / pick it up and take it somewhere else
okay so the uh man in the clip uh was on a walk when he found uh the baby and uh he didn’t know where the baby uh came from so he uh searched for the parents of the baby and he put the baby to uh uh woman uh because he thought the woman left her baby in uh behind the trash and uh the woman uh was angry because it was not her baby so he searched again uh for the own= uh the parents of the baby and uh he did not find the parents and left the baby again where the trash was and uh a police officer came and uh thought he left the baby there so he took the baby again and uh walked around to look for the parents  and then he just uh unwanted to get rid of the baby and uh gave the baby to a man / which put the baby again to the woman I think and uh / after a long time he uh / got the baby again and uh / he / didn’t know what to do because uh he could not find the parents and uh at the end he found a letter of the real parents which uh / said that the new uh / so-called parents should take care of the baby and uh after he wanted to get rid of the baby he just decided to take the baby with him and left.
Hello uh I watched the movie or the short film about Charlie Chaplin and I saw first Charlie Chaplin with his signature look and his shoes and his uh walking stick walking along the street and he uh he was hit by trash thrown through the window but I as a viewer I couldn’t identify who throw this trash and then he is a bit or his uh gesture and his face looks a bit uh yeah annoyed or he is yeah he’s a bit aggressive about this experience and then he lits or he tries to lit a cigarette or yeah a cigarette and uh suddenly he see or he saw uh a baby lying on the street in a corner and uh he looks around and no one is is there and he he takes the baby and uh is still searching for his or her mother probably and I as a viewer I saw a woman walking behind Charlie Chaplin with another baby in a in a / not a wheel chair but uh yeah and she enters uh a shop or a house and Charlie Chaplin turns around and he takes the the probably orphan baby orphan child and puts it to the other baby from the woman and he se= seems to look or he looks really happy about it because he found his or her mother but the woman comes out of the shop and she’s really annoyed and aggressive that Charlie Chaplin uh gave her uh yeah unknown child and he returns or he uh she gives the child back to Charlie Chaplin and he’s confused and uh yeah walks back to the place to the corner where he found the child and he uh wants to hhh uh put it back hhh on the ground but uh a police officer comes across and uh Charlie Chaplin uh stops his action and he yeah tries to walk away and uh hhh doesn’t co= get in a conflict with the police officer after that another person uh enters the story for me was like an old man who walked really slow and Charlie Chaplin like uh / yeah he tries to maybe close his shoes or something like that and / for me it looked like he asked the man could you hold the baby for a second or something but there was no language and the old man takes the baby and Charlie Chaplin runs away hhh and the old man walks really fast so he couldn’t reach Charlie Chaplin or can keep return the baby to him hhh so he walks through the streets of this maybe small city or yeah and he comes across the first baby from the woman in uh in the wagon uh and the old man puts the baby in the wagon because he thinks this baby belongs to the other baby maybe they are siblings or something like that and uh / a minute or a second later Charlie Chaplin or a lot of other people walk across these two babies uh and Charlie Chaplin walks uh by and the woman comes out of the house again or yeah returns to h=her chil her child and the other child and then she h=hits uh hit Charlie Chaplin because she was  so frustrated about Charlie Chaplin because he out of her perspective he tried to return the baby to her twice but she knows it’s not her baby and she thinks it’s his probably so Charlie Chaplin ends with the baby in his arms and he walks like down the streets and uh he sat down and then he found or yeah he looked maybe for but he found a little sheet of paper where I couldn’t read properly but uh there was written like uh please love ‘n’ care for an orphan orphan child so uh in the end he keeps the baby and the last scene is that he walks away with the baby in his arm.
it’s a man walking down the street smoking a cigarette suddenly uh he is hit by something which is thrown out of a window uh which makes him stop then he finds uh a baby laying in a corner and he picks it up and uh doesn’t know / which uh whose yeah whose baby it is uh and then he he sees a lady with uh a child and he brings the baby to her and uh in the moment the lady doesn’t look he lays the baby to her kid and in the uh / in the thing where you carry babies around hhh and uh when the when the woman sees it she gets angry and he takes the baby back then he wants to lay it to back in the corner where he found it but a police man comes around and he just well picks it up again and walks away then pretending that he uh needs to close his shoes he gives it to a man and then he runs away but the man uh f= I think he finds him again uh / yeah never mind he has but he gives the baby back to the man / and the uh policeman is basically walking around the streets all the time and uh sees the situation again ‘n’ again with the woman or with the other man or just him carrying the baby doesn’t who= and he doesn’t know what’s going on and in the end the man sits down and finds a letter which is uh yeah which the baby basically carries with it and then he reads the letter and it says that he shall please carry uh care for the baby and uh love the baby and then he walks away with the baby smiling
so in the beginning of the video Charlie Chaplin walks down the street while things get thrown at him from above someone even screams awkward ass he then lights a cigarette and turns around and sees a baby lying in the corner uh he then picks the baby up and walks turns around in that moment he sees a woman with a carrier walker behind him the woman goes into the building and leaves the carrier outside so Charlie decides to put the baby in it as the woman’s com= as the woman comes out she says to him pardon mister you drop something and puts the baby in the carrier but the woman seems furious and makes clear that the baby isn’t hers so Charlie takes out the baby again and then walks back to the corner where he picked up the baby he l=lays the  baby down and gets up and turns around while he sees a policeman standing behind himthe policeman looks stri=strictly at him so Charlie turns around and picks the baby up again he then starts walking around and turns a corner when he sees a man he goes up to the man and acts like his sho=shoe’s undone so he asked of them to hold the baby and he acts like he wants to tie his shoes again but he actually runs away away so the man is left with the baby the baby uh the man then walks down the street again and sees the carrier with a baby in it so he decides to put the child in the carrier  he then walks away in the same moment Charlie walks down the street and the woman comes out which happens to be the woman from before he se= she sees Charlie and runs after him she beats him and is very angry with him uh and pulls him back to the carrier and tells him to take the baby again Charlie is again for=forced to do so because the policeman th= the same policeman came up to him again so Charlie takes  the baby and walks down the street and sits by the street and thinks about putting the baby in the drain but he doesn’t do so so he looks at the baby and then cuts his finger so he finds / a paper / which was hidden in the banklet of the baby and this on this paper is written please take care of this orphan child so Charlie then decides to keep the baby
it is a black ‘n’ white movie from Charlie Chaplin called The Kid and it it starts where Charlie Chaplin is walking down / a dirty street and uh he gets get hits by uh / tra= uh / cabbage thrown out of the window and / he was smoking before / and / uh he lost his / cigarette so he stops and hi= lits up a new cigarette / hhh uh / but then he sees a little baby all / by his own only / wrapped in blankets / he takes the baby and is wondering what to do with the baby so he sees a mother walking by / and / he drops it off in the / baby car of the mother / but / the mother turns around and / gets angry because / she looks like it it’s not her baby and she says okay you / forgot something so he has / to take the baby with him and wants to place it back but a / policeman comes back by / hhh comes back and / uh / so Charlie Chaplin feels he can’t drop the baby ‘n’ takes it with him hhh / and / a ol= man is walking by so / he ask him to hold the baby for a minute / to / close the shoe but and then starts running away / so he got rid of the baby / but the old man is placing the baby back in the car of the mother from before / hhh and uh / the mother gets really angry / again because it’s not her baby / and see / see she sees Charlie Chaplin / and / thinks that he dropped again the baby in her baby car / hhh and / uh so Charlie Chaplin has to take the baby back and / uh / then / he uh / finds a paper / that uh / if someone finds the baby / he should care ‘n’ love the baby / and / he can= let the baby all on his own on the street so he takes the baby ‘n’ looks like he wants / to care for the baby
okay so uh he walks down the street as someone is emptying his or her trash out of the window and he got almost hit by the trash that’s why he stopped and uh as soon as he stopped uh he saw a baby lying on the street which he / uh yeah took in a way and he uh as soon as he took it he tries to get rid of it ‘cos he obviously doesn’t know what to do with the baby so uh he meets a woman with uh who is uh yeah  going down the street with her own child and he tries to put it in her stroller I think ‘n’ then uh she gets mad ‘cos she obviously doesn’t want to take care of two children ‘n’ she doesn’t know what to do with this / yeah / uh with this child so uh yeah then he uh takes it out out of the stroller again and uh he keeps walking down the street and keeps trying to find oh no before that he uh is trying to lay the baby back on the ground but then the police officer also uh comes and uh yeah I guess pretty mad ‘cos he obviously thinks that he uh tries to get rid of his own son or daughter uh in the middle of the street and uh so uh he can’t do that obviously so Chaplin uh carries the baby or keeps on carrying the baby uh and uh yeah he needs to do it again again it doesn’t work out to you know get rid of the baby hhh somehow and uh in the end he is uh sitting on the pavement and uh he’s looking at the baby ‘n’ he’s finding uh this kind of a letter or note saying love ‘n’ love the baby and take care of it something like that and so uh he probably gets emotional and uh walks away with the baby in his arms so I guess he’s trying to keep it and uh love it and take care of it because the parents are not around
uh in the short video you can see a man who finds a baby and then he tries to get rid of the baby because he doesn't want to have it and he sees uh a a mother walking around with another baby and he thinks that the baby that he found belongs to the other woman so uh he tries to give it to her but she doesn't want to have it so it's not her baby obviously and then uh hhh he tries to get rid of it in another way he just I think he just laid the baby on the ground but then another man came by and saw how he just put it on the ground and then he uh took the baby again and ran away with it and in the end he couldn't get rid of the baby because of many different reasons and then he saw a note in the baby's uh I don't know how it's called I think it's like a blanket and there he found a note which says uh I think take care of the orphan child so it means that the baby is an orphan and because of that uh the man decides to keep it to keep the baby and then he takes the baby home
uh so the video is a Charlie Chaplin movie and in the beginning there's a man walking down the street uh it looks like a back street with no other people and a lot of trash he uh eventually finds a baby next to some trash and picks it up uh then a woman with a trolley walks by and he assumes that the baby is hers uh so he wants to give it to her but she uh claims it not it's not hers and he uh should take it back so he takes it and decides to put it back where he found it but while he puts it down to the ground a police off= officer walks by and makes him take it and so he takes the baby and walks further on and then he meets a man and he tr= tricks the man to take the baby and wants to run away so now the man is stuck with the baby uh that man meets the same woman with a trolley and while she's not looking he puts the baby back in the trolley uh when the woman notices that the second baby is in her trolley the protagonist walks by and so she hits and fights the man so he would take back the baby uh ‘n’ then he's again stuck with the baby and walks on uh eventually he sits down on the edge of the street and tries to think of other ways to get rid of the baby uh but then he finds a little note on the baby which says to love and care for the orphan child and then he seems to decide to keep it for himself
uh we can see Charlie Chaplin walking through the streets ‘n’ there’re two persons I think there first we ca= we can see the first person throwing trash on him ‘n’ bu= we ca= uh we can’t see the second person hhh / uh after the second person throws the trash on him / uh he gets angry and lights a cigarette hhh / uh after that he finds the baby covered in sheets laying / on the street / uh hhh uh he picks it up and sees a woman walking walking pass with a / baby buggy and he thinks th= maybe the mother lost her baby and he tries to catch her and hhh / uh wanted to put the baby back in the uh even puts the baby back in the uh carriage but / then it turns out that the baby / uh / the it isn’t her baby and she gets angry hhh / and then he / yeah puts the baby back uh in his arms and wants to put it back on the street but / uh after doing that a policeman appea= app= appears and hhh / uh he has to put it back up and / hhh after that yeah he tries to get rid of the baby and hhh / uh / I think yeah he hands it to an old man who cannot really walk because he only can walk with the stick and / hhh then he yeah he gifts he giv= gives it to him and runs away / ‘n’ the old man does the same as Charlie Chaplin did before / he / tries to put it back in the baby buggy baby carriage of the of the uh mother / ‘n’ walks away / but uh / after that Charlie uh / runs / passed her ‘n’ she sees him and then / hhh uh / he thinks he / tried to put the baby in there twi= uh the uh for the uh / for the second time / ‘n’ then she beats him up gets angry ‘n’ the policema= the policeman appears again / ‘n’ Charlie has to put the baby / out of the carriage again / and uh sits on the street / uh / ‘n’ even / yeah he thinks of of throwing the baby in the in the drain / in the drain is that the co= I think that is a correct word uh / hhh but in the end he didn= uh he doesn’t do that and hhh / hhh uh finds a a letter / which which says something like uh / care for this / orphan child orphan baby or something hhh / and yeah then he / hhh yeah starts to starts to en= enjoy his responsibility for the baby and / he uh yeah / he smiles ‘n’ then walks away / through a little side street
okay in this video a man is walking down the streets he finds a baby lying on the ground and takes it then he sees a woman walking by with another baby and puts it to the other baby because he’s thinking that she lost the baby the woman argues with him and he has to take it back then he tries to put it back where he found it where he found it yeah and a police man is walking by so he has to take it back again then again uh then he tries to trick an old man to holding the baby while he’s pretending to tie his shoes and then he’s running away uh through some accidents the old man is putting the baby to the other baby from the woman from beforehand hhh and the woman sees the man who actually found the baby walking by and argues again with him so he has to take it back hhh then he sits down with the baby on his arms and uh finds a letter in his clothe that is saying that this baby is an orphan child and then he decides to take care of it
okay so the video starts and we see Charlie Chaplin walking walking down the street with a cigarette and then he sees a baby just lying on the fl= on the ground and he goes by it and picks it up and is asking himself what what is up here and looks around and he sees no one and he walks walks out of the corner of the street where he where he found the baby and sees a woman with a buggy with another child in it and uh he sees the woman going into a shop and leaving the buggy down uh on the street and uh he he has the idea to just put the baby into the buggy because I don't know maybe he thinks two is the same as one and he puts the baby in the buggy then the woman comes out and sees it and she's very upset and uh wants wants Charlie Chaplin to uh take the baby back uh which he does and he's walking around with baby in his arms and still doesn't really know what to do with it and then he goes back into the corner where the he found the baby and just tries to put it back uh but after he turns around there's a policeman standing in front of him looking at him and Charlie Chaplin is of course a bit frightened and picks the baby back up and is / yeah fs= uh looking for another way to get rid of it basically uh he giv= goes to a man who's just walking arou= down the street and puts the baby in his arms the man is a bit confused and in a similar situation as Charlie Chaplin himself with a baby and tries try to chase Charlie Chaplin down who's running away uh Charlie Chaplin hides behind uh behind uh behind a wall and the man can’t find him so the man t= actually tries the same and puts the baby into the buggy of the same woman uh she does not notice but after that Charlie Chaplin comes along happy that he get rid of the baby and he sees Charlie Chaplin and remembers him and sees the second baby that is in her buggy so she thinks that Charlie Chaplin put it back in there again so she punches him with her with her uh uh thing that keeps the rain away uh and he again has to take the baby back and is pretty clueless about what to do next and goes with the baby to to a street and sits down and finally looks at the baby for the first time for like more than a second and he finds a letter and looks at the letter and it says love and care for this orphan child ‘n’ then he realizes that the baby is still a human being and he smiles and it seems like he wants to take care of it now
so the story starts off with the main character wearing a top hat and a coat walking down an alley and some construction workers are throwing bricks and like trash from the buildings so the character dodges some but suddenly gets hit and very angry so he lights a cigarette to calm down probably while he’s lighting a cigarette he sees a baby lying behind a trashcan and decides to pick it up hhh so then a woman with a stroller comes by and he assumes that it's hi= her baby so he goes to the st= stroller and lays it in hhh but the woman the woman gets angry and I think she hits him but at least he's she's screaming at him so he takes the baby out and tries to / lay it back to the trashcan because it's not him but a policeman sees him and he decides to pick it up again and go away because he don't want to get in trouble with the policeman so then he tries to give it to a stranger pretending he has to lace his shoes so he's giving it to the stranger the stranger is holding the baby and he pretends to lace his shoes then he runs away from the stranger and he’s hiding the stranger then tries the same trick as the uh protagonist or the top hat man and is laying the baby in the same cart from the same woman from before hhh so and then the protagonist comes from his hiding spot down the alley no down the street from the alley where the woman with the now again wrong baby is standing with the stroller and then she notices him ‘n’ is assuming that he put the baby inside again so he hits him and is calling the policeman from before and then the protagonist has to pick up the g= the baby again from the stroller and is thinking about another way to get rid of it so he goes to some kind of / alley or street and is sitting down next to a sewer and is trying to or is at least thinking about throwing the baby in the sewer so he's opening the canal closure and thinks about it for a second but then decides to not do it and is holding the baby in his arms while it's doing that he is finding i= a little note saying please take care of this orphan or please love it and that's basically the last scene and he decides to keep it I guess
okay uh the short movie the kid by Charles Chaplin is about a young man who was walking through the city and found a baby in the street and he picked it up and didn't know what to do with it so he tried to return it to his owner at first that was uh his mom not his owner his mom there was a young lady he thought she could be the mom of the baby or the nanny of the baby but she wasn't and so she gave the baby back to him and he tried to put it back where he found it but a police officer interrupted him by doing so and / uh so he had to take the baby back and gave it to an old man he then saw the woman with a I think it's a carriage I don't know with the carriage and put it to the other baby she she soon found out that there was another baby in her carriage she recognized the baby and she recognized the young man again in the street so he had to take the baby back because she got hurt by a police officer and in the end he was sitting down one of the streets and thinking about what he's going to do next then he found a letter with the baby where it was written something like that this was an orphan child and somebody should adopt him and love him and so he was taking the baby ‘n’ walking out of the picture and so we could assume that he maybe take the baby in / I think that was about it
okay uh in the video we can see uh Charlie Chaplin walking down uh a backstreet uh and I think he's going to smoke ‘n’ then he sees uh a baby on the floor and uh he goes to pick him or her up and then the mother comes by ‘n’ he thinks that she dropped the baby ‘n’ he puts uh the baby in uh in her carriage I think uh and then she's furious because not her baby of course and uh he takes uh the baby back and uh goes to put the baby back where he found the baby and in that moment a policeman comes by and uh of course policeman thinks he's doing some weird stuff and he takes the baby back and goes a different way uh and sees a man walking there and uh he tricks him into taking the baby ‘n’ then runs away and then by fate he uh comes across the woman from earlier and the man who had the baby uh took took him or her and also did the same thing Charlie did earlier and uh of course the woman thinks then that uh Charlie Chaplin did it and uh she beats him up with an umbrella I think and uh then the policeman from earlier comes by and uh Charlie Chaplin then takes the baby and uh goes to sit down with him or her and uh for the first time he really takes a look and finds a letter and uh I think a letter says please love and care for this orphan child and he then smiles at the baby and we see him walking away and probably doing just that what the letter says
in the video the man or a man is walking down the street and uh occasionally gets thrown garbage at and while he lits himself a cigarette or a cigar I couldn't really tell he finds a baby picks it up and looks around if somebody is there then uh finds a woman who's uh / with her baby in a buggy and I he tries to put it in there in there but uh / the woman doesn't she insists on that he will= he would take the baby with him because it's not hers obviously and then he tries to put it back where he found it but a police officer catches him and he picks it up again so he tries his= another attempt with a man walk I think he has a walking stick and uh he I think he asks him if he could uh hold the baby while he's tying his shoes so uh that the man with the walking stick is holding the baby and he runs off the man with the walking stick then puts the baby back into the buggy of the same woman that he uh accidentally walked past and uh he then goes off and the the man in the beginning who found the baby uh / walks again I think accidentally passed the woman and she comes out the store she see= she sees that there is another baby and then sees the man again runs after him and gets him back uh and when the woman calls him the police officer uh he the man gets the baby xxx again and uh to avoid any conversation or argument / oh wait there's also the end where uh he's taking the baby and walking around I think not knowing what to do then sitting on the the street curb or uh and then thinking about throwing the baby down the gutter but he isn't doing that and finds a letter and uh that I think that it's abandoned and somebody should take care of it and he just gets up and I guess keeps it
Chaplin is uh walking down an alleyway and gets hit by some garbage someone has thrown out the window after putting out a new cigar out of his box he finds a baby lying on the ground and decides to put it up / a woman walks by with a buggy with the child in it and he thinks that the child belongs to the mother / he puts the child into the buggy because uh because it's for two childs but uh the mother notices it and uh forces him to take back the random child / he decides to / put it back to where he finds it but a policeman / but the policeman watched him doing it and he has to / take it with him but he doesn't want to have a random baby with him so he just gives him gives it to some random old man and runs away the o= old man isn't able to find him and accidentally puts the baby into the same buggy Chaplin does before did before / Chaplin walks by the buggy a few seconds later and the woman notices again and beats him up with the umbrella and is forced to take the baby again / and after noticing a little note inside uh wi= with the baby uh probably from the mother it says that whoever finds the baby should take care of uh the baby and so Chaplin decides to take care of the child
uh in this short video clip Charles Chaplin the baby hhh and there is Charlie Chaplin who walks yeah who walks around a small street and finds a baby lying beside some bins and so he takes the baby and when a woman walks by he thinks that the woman has forgotten her baby or has lost the baby so he walks towards her and wants to give her the baby back into her baby bug= buggy but uh yeah the woman shows that it is definitely not her baby and she gets angry so Charles Chaplin takes the baby back and uh wants to put it back to the place where he found it on the ground uh there was a policeman who stands behind him who takes him that he should take the baby back and should not put it on the ground so Charle Chaplin swiftly takes the baby and walks away uh he walks around the corner and so and he meets a man who yeah whom he wants to give the baby he pretends that the man should hold the baby uh but then he swiftly runs away the old man then gets angry and walks with the baby toward a shop where a baby buggy is standing in front of the shop uh when he arrives there he puts the baby into the baby buggy but the woman the mother of the other baby is the is the woman with the baby buggy whom he wants to hand the baby uh before which Charles Chaplin has already tried to put the baby into the buggy so the woman gets angry again and uh Charlie Chaplin walks by and meets the woman again and she gets more angry than before there is also the police officer who who walks by and sees the encounter and uh when Charle Chaplin sees him as well he takes the baby again and walks away finally he sits down and reads a letter which was yeah which was handed by the baby and uh yeah he reads the he reads the small letter which tells that uh which has the words please care and love this orphan child Charles Chaplin reads the letter and uh yeah holds the he holds the small child in his arms and then finally settles down with the baby
okay Charlie Chaplin is walking down the street and other people are throwing rubbish out of the window uh onto him uh the second time anybody is doing that he's lighting up his cigarettes and then he's finding a baby lying on the street behind uh a bin uh and first he's struggling with uh thinking what he should do or thinking about what he should do uh but he decides to pick up the baby and uh he seems kind of helpless but then he wants to put the baby back into no a woman comes by with a a pram and another baby and then he's uh trying to put the baby he found into the pram but the woman comes back to the pram and uh gives out to him so uh he has to take back the baby and then he wants to put the baby back where he found it but uh while doing that uh a policeman is walking by ‘n’ kind of looking at him what are you doing there and so he has to pick up the baby again and he's walking a bit uh and he finds another man he tries to give the baby to the other man and he's kind of successful by running away and the other man finds the woman with the pram and the other baby and puts the baby in there as well but uh the woman comes out of the shop and sees the baby in there again and she's kind of mad uh that the baby is in there again and uh / Charlie Chaplin is walking by the woman and she remembers him from the first time he put the baby in there even though he didn't the second time so she gives out to him and kind of hits him with an umbrella ‘n’ then the policeman walks by again so Charlie has to uh take the baby again ‘n’ then he's sitting uh down at the edge of a sidewalk holding the baby and looking is there any message in uh whatever the baby has around uh his or herself him or herself uh and / uh he finds uh a tiny sheet which says uh please love and care for this orphan child uh so he / doesn't uh put the baby into the gully which was his first plan after sitting down uh and he decides to keep the baby
uh the video started with a man walking down the street uh which or who is Chaplin uh there were fa= bricks falling down on him but they were missed him by I think two seconds or something then he walked into a side road where uh somebody th= threw bri= bricks at him which hit him at the end and uh he uh picked up I think cigarettes or something and uh lit them up while taking off his gloves and putting them into the bin and in that moment he saw uh saw a baby uh lying down the foor floor ly= lying down on the floor with uh blankets wrapped around him he picked up the baby and uh thought about what to do with him uh when he walked down the road and saw a woman with a stroller walking by uh he tried to put or sh= smuggle the baby into the stroller and walk away but the woman saw him and uh argued with him and uh after all after that Chaplin took the baby back and tried to think about what to do with him he well he walked back to the place where he found the baby and tried to put the baby back to the ground when a police officer walked by and saw what happened that was why Chaplin had to pick the baby back up and uh tried to find another solution he uh saw a old man walking by and tried to uh or gave the baby to the old man and walked away and tried to hide somewhere so the old man doesn't find him the old man uh coincidentally walked by the stroller or the woman with a stroller and put the baby back into the stroller and walked away uh when Chaplin uh coincidentally walked also walked by the stroller again and the woman saw him and uh sh= started to hit him and argue with him and uh the Chaplin started discussing I think uh if he could giv= or I don't know what he was discussing about but he discussed with a woman when the police officer came back and uh Chaplin was forced to take the baby back and walk away and walking away he tried to find another solution what to do with the baby when he sat down on a sidewalk and uh just shortly thought about putting the baby down the drain or something and uh then after noticing that that is not the best solution he uh found a note inside of the blanket of the baby and uh on that note was written please love and care for the orphan child uh after reading that note Chaplin happily decided to keep the baby and walked away
okay so uh the video starts with Charles Chaplin walking along a run-down area where uh bricks apparently uh fall off the roof and uh as he walks along uh some bricks fall onto him and uh the cigar he's smoking uh falled out of his mouth so he decides to take a break and uh uh light uh wants to light his smoke again uh as he uh does it he sees a baby uh on the floor to his left and uh is a bit clueless why it's lying on the floor so he picks it up and uh then sees uh a mother with a= her baby walking uh along and thinks that the baby might be hers so he wants to give it to her but uh the baby apparently isn't hers and she's getting angry that the Charle Chaplin wants to give her the baby so uh he takes it back and uh doesn't know what to do with it so uh he plans to take it back where he found it uh and wants to put it on the floor but then an officer walks along and uh sees Chaplin doing that so he uh he thinks that Charles Chaplin wants to drop off the baby and uh Chaplin picks the baby up and walks away instead of getting into trouble so uh as he walks along he doesn't really know what to do so he tries to be uh trick an man he walks beside and uh thi= uh im= uh thinks he can trick him through uh pretending that he has something on his shoe and wants to uh wipe it off or something gives the baby to the older man and then runs away so the older man has now the baby and uh he doesn't know what to do and he sees the mother uh with her baby Charles has seen before uh and wants to give her the baby as well so uh he uh gives it to him but uh and walks away and at the same time Chaplin walks uh just carries on walking basically and uh then comes across the mom with her baby again the mom just noticed then that the she has the baby she's seen before uh and thinks Chaplin has put the baby in her carriage it again so uh she tells him he needs to pick up the baby and uh keeps on moving that the baby isn't hers and uh then the officer from before is there as well and uh tells Chaplin he needs to take the baby so Chaplin uh / grabs the baby and uh just walks away with it he’s a bit clueless what to do and uh then finds a letter in the rags of the baby and uh reads it where it says that the baby is an orphan and uh the person who found it or that uh they hope that he finds a new uh parent basically who c= loves him and uh Chaplin decides to keep the baby and walks away with it
okay so in this short video sequence we see Charlie Chaplin walking down the street uh ‘n’ then he while he's walking he gets hit by bricks falling down from a house on the side of the road uh which kind of confuses him and he tries to find the source of those bricks and looks around and then his gaze uh meets a little baby lying uh besides an garbage bin so he he approaches the baby ‘n’ looks at it and doesn't really know what to do then he picks it up looks at it again ‘n’ then uh yeah just tries to figure out whe= where it came from uh then he sees a lady hhh with a uh pram with a pram uh and he walks walks towards her and uh tries well ‘n’ then he she the lady stops in front of a shop or anything and then he uh yeah se= secretly tries to put the baby in her pram uh / but it doesn't really work because she comes she enters the road again ‘n’ then uh she gets angry with him and he has to take the baby back from her so he continues walking down the road again and trying to look for another opportunity to get rid of the baby ‘n’ then he meets this kind of old man beggar person and he kind of / uh just puts the baby in his arms and then runs away with oh I think before he does that he tries to or he he puts the baby back on the ground besides the garbage bin uh again but he's being stopped by a policeman how sees him I forgot that anyway so uh hhh after that he uh puts the baby in this in in the arms of this beggar older elderly person whatever and runs away very fast uh / uh in the back right the the old person this old man uh is of course confused because of this baby in his arms and he wants to get rid of it as well and meets the same lady with the pram that Charlie Chaplin met before and he tries to tries the same tries in the same way to get rid of the baby by pu= putting it in the pram uh ‘n’ then he walks away and just at the moment when the lady hhh uh re-enters the scene uh Charlie Chaplin passes her which is very bad for him because she of course recognizes him ‘n’ gets angry again and yeah well he ends up with the baby in his arms again uh and then I think he's he doesn't he's not really sure what to do and he keeps on walking ‘n’ then there's this policeman I hhh I'm not sure I think he meets the policeman as= again / and he just I= I think in the end he just figures out that there's no way to get rid of this kid ‘n’ he yeah sits down on the pavement looks at the child and then he sees a little note which says uh love please love and care for this orphan child or kid whatever yeah and then he kind of finds his peace with it and smiles at the baby and stands up ‘n’ walks away
okay uh a man walks through streets of what appears to be a poor neighborhood uh you can see that because of all the dirt trash lying around also the man seems quite poor uh hhh indicated by the little cigarette butts he collects and smokes uh hhh yeah behind a corner he finds a baby lying in the street in the dirt and uh picks it up as he turns around he sees a woman with a baby carriage or a buggy uh passing by and walks towards that woman and puts the baby into the carriage because he assumes that uh the woman dropped the baby so he wants to give it back to her but apparently the woman doesn't know the baby and uh doesn't want to take it and forces the man to take the baby back uh yes he now does not really know what to do with seems little desperate hhh uh and wants to drop it in the streets again but then a officer comes by and uh yeah the man decides to pick the baby up again hhh uh and uh yeah when he sees an old man walking by he tricks the old man into taking the baby and runs away uh hhh the old man / who has now the baby uh hhh sees the the the the buggy of the the mother uh from before which stands outside the shop the mother is inside so he puts the baby into the into the into the buggy and walks away uh when the mother comes out of the shop and realizes that there is a uh the baby the the the foreign baby uh unfortunately or the the the the first man who originally picked up the bab= baby from the streets walked by and the mother forces him to take the baby back by beating him up and calling the police uh yeah so now the man has the baby again and uh seems very desperate about it even thinks about throwing the baby into the sewers but then he yeah uh he he he can't do it hhh and as he uh looks at the baby he finds a note that says take good care of this orphan child so he realizes that someone uh someone put it there for a reason that someone finds it and takes care of it so he decides to keep it and seems also very happy about it and walks away
Charles Chaplin as the main character of the video uh walks through a city that seems a bit des= destroyed and as he stops to light a cigarette he finds an infant uh lying in a corner and he picks it up uh trying to maybe save it and as he looks around if uh there's the mother of the child he uh finds a woman with a uh stroller and he assumes that the child belongs to her and puts it in her stroller uh hhh but the woman denies that this is her child so he takes the child back and as he wants to put it back uh in the corner where he found it an officer uh notices that and uh tells them that he cannot do that leaving a child in a street so he picks the child up again and sees a stranger uh he puts the child into the stranger's arms pretending that he has to tie his laces but uh runs away and hides from the stranger the stranger again uh runs after Charles Chaplin and finds the mother with her baby carriage again and uh hhh puts the baby back into the stroller and uh as Charles Chaplin thinks he can uh walk by the mother of uh hhh uh th= the baby uh carriage uh comes out of the store again and sees that there's the second baby in her carriage again as she sees Charles Chaplin she thinks he put the baby in the stroller again and knocks him down with her umbrella uh the officer comes by to see what the matter is hhh and uh forces Charles Chaplin to take the baby with him again uh he does so and uh seems a bit confused what to do with the baby he sits down on the sidewalk and tries to think about what to do next and then he finds a note uh in the baby's clothes saying that uh hhh to take care and to love that orphan child and uh yeah so he seems to decide that he can take the baby home by himself
hhh ok so the clip begins with a protagonist walking along the street and almost being hit by trash being thrown out of a window / hhh twice actually and then he lights a he takes a tin box with a cigarette hhh and light the match on the shoe and when he looks down he sees a baby laying on the ground so he picks it up and looks around like he is looking for the mother and sees the trolley uh abandoned standing on the side so he places the baby inside but the owner of the trolley probably also a mother uh sees him and since it isn’t her baby he has to take it with him again hhh so he leaves the scenery and then sees another man walking along the street so he talks to him and pretends he has to tie his shoe lace and asks him to hold the baby which he does so the protagonist bends down and then runs away leaving the other man with the baby hhh who is then the owner of the little child and hhh then he leaves the scenery again and places the baby in the same trolley we se= saw before hhh and leaves and the mother of the trolley of the other child uh then exits a building just as the protagonist from the beginning passes the trolley and her and she sees the baby so she obviously assumes he placed it there again just like he did before so she runs after him hits him with an umbrella and drags him back to the / hhh the trolley / hands him the baby again and then the policeman becomes involved he takes it without any protest and leaves once more walks along the street and drops his uh walking stick and sits down briefly considers dropping the child in the gutter which he doesn’t and closes the gutter again and then finds the little letter hidden in the clothes of the baby which reads please love ‘n’ care for the orphan child so he looks at the baby for a moment and then takes him with her as he leaves again and that where it ends
in the short clip you see Charlie Chaplin walking down a dusty road and he gets hit by rubbish that people throw out of the windows uh and he loses his ciga= cigar so uh when he lights a news one he throws his gloves uh in a trashcan and then he sees a baby laying on the ground uh he picks it up and yeah tries to figure out where / or who= whom it belong to and sees a woman with a pram so he thinks alright it’s her baby she lost it and the woman is in a shop but the pram is outside on the street so he puts it in there uh and then the woman sees it and yeah hurries out and shouts at him that this is not her baby and uh he picks it up and yeah walks back to the spot where he found it and as he puts it on the ground again he notices that there is a police officer coming along and he yeah to avoid confrontation he picks it up again quickly and hurries away then he sees a or he walks past uh a man with a limp and he fools him into uh holding the baby while he pretends to tie his shoe and as the ol= elderly man uh holds the baby he runs away uh the man with the limp is of course not as fast as him so he yeah he loses sight of him and he walks past or he hurries past the lady with the pram so he just puts the baby in there and walks away uh Charlie uh again sees the police officer so he quickly turns another way and happens to uh walk past the pram as well and in exactly this moment the woman comes out of the shop and yeah sees uh the baby that’s not hers in the pram again and sees Charlie and she yeah she figures that he put it in there again so she runs after him and attacks him with her umbrella / and uh drags him back to the pram and in this moment the police officer walks by again and yeah he notices the fight so Charlie quickly takes the baby and hurries away and then he sits on the curb and he finds a note uh in the baby’s clothes and it says that the baby is an orphan and yeah needs to be loved and cared for and then he looks at it again and yeah decides to take care of it
so the main character of the movie finds an abandoned baby uh ‘n’ then he sees the woman who already has uh a baby with her he then proceeds to give uh the baby to the woman however the woman gives him the baby back uh ‘n’ then he wants to uh lay the baby down where he found it but a police officer stops him uh he then takes the baby with him again uh then he gets another man to hold the baby for him and then he runs away uh hhh the other man then meet the aforementioned woman again and gives the baby to her but the woman no no he gives the baby to her and then uh the main character walks passed the woman and the woman gives the baby back to the main character uh then the main character sits down with the baby and uh we can see him kind of thinking about what to do and then he finds a little note uh in the baby’s clothes and the note says uh something to the fact of it being a orphan child and that the person who finds it should take care of it and uh yeah the main character reads that note and then decides to uh take the baby with him again
in the video Charlie Chaplin uh walks down / a back alley it it appears to be a back alley and he gets hhh thrown at with different things I I presume to be de= debris of some sort uh some trash and he comes across a few trash bins and there he finds a baby laying on the ground he looks at it he picks it up and he looks around trying to find out who the baby belongs to and in that moment behind him there is a woman with a pram walking away from him hhh and she goes into one of the buildings and he thought that the baby might be hers so he puts the baby in the pram with the child of the woman and she comes out and he says to her that she might’ve dropped something and uh the woman / well the woman is kind of mad and tells him to take the baby again because it’s not hers so she he takes it she walks away and Charlie Chaplin tries to put the baby back where he found it on the ground next to the trash cans and the officer well a police officer he comes uh around the corner and he sees Charlie Chaplin dropping the baby trying to walk away and looks at him so Chaplin takes the baby back into his arms and walks away / then he sees uh another gentleman walking down another alley and / gives him the baby pretends to tie his shoe and then when the gentleman looks at the baby he runs away leaving the gentleman with the baby who then starts to look for whom this baby might belong to and xxx he comes across the same woman from before and puts the baby into the pram and he gets away with it so he walks away and when the woman comes out back to her pram she sees Chaplin walking past after being confused for a couple of seconds why the baby was back again he walks past he didn’t notice her and she comes after him hitting her hitting him with her umbrella / and he has to take the baby again even though this time he didn’t put it there and then he sits down at the curb looking at the baby ‘n’ contemplating to maybe throw it in the sewer but he doesn’t do that instead he finds a note inside the blankets uh that the baby is wrapped in which says please care for this orphan child or please love ‘n’ care for this orphan child and he smiles at the baby and stands up with it in his arms and walks away
ok so the video is about a man walking through an alley minding his own business when when he finds a / small child lying on the ground just uh lying there in the corner he picks it up pick picks the child up and assumes that it’s from a lady who’s uh walking around with another baby so he tries to hhh uh hand the baby over to her assuming its hers uh she tells him in not so nice words that it’s not her baby and refuses to take the child uh so the man walks back and uh yeah just wants to put the baby on the ground where he found uh the child / but uh he’s uh is uh yeah watched by a police officer so he can’t just leave the baby / uh yeah so his next idea is to give the baby to an older man and just uh to run away but it turns out the old older person has the same idea as the first man did and uh hhh tries to give the baby to the woman with the other child uh just as the f= first man walks by the woman notices uh this and uh yeah short conflict ensues and uh it’s / yeah the man has to take the baby back because the police officer officer’s watching again and threatens him basically so hhh the man sits down and has no idea what to do with the baby for a short moment he thinks about just uh dumping it but then he finds a small letter uh in the baby’s wraps uh stating that the baby is an orphan child and asking / uh to take care of the child which the man decides to do
uh we see Charlie Chaplin walking through the streets and people are throwing thrash out of the windows ‘n’ some thrash hits Charlie Chaplin and he gets annoyed ‘n’ starts lighting his cigarette and uh then he sees a baby lying in a corner and he picks up the baby ‘n’ looks around but he can’t see anyone uh around uh so then he starts searching for someone the baby might belong to and he sees a woman with a pram walking by and  then he while the woman goes inside a house he lays the baby in the pram and tries to walk away but the woman comes out again and she gets angry because she already has a baby ‘n’ she doesn’t want this baby ‘n’ it’s not her baby uh so she says uh that Chaplin should take the baby again and Chaplin starts wandering off and he wants to lay the baby back where he found it but while he does that a police officer uh walks by and he uh he says that Chaplin isn’t allowed to do that just dropping off the baby so Chaplin picks up the baby again and uh starts wandering around and then he sees an old man who can’t walk really well and he asks the old man to uh hold the baby so he can tie his shoes and the old man picks the baby uh and Chaplin acts as if he wants to tie his shoes but then he runs away ‘n’ the old man can’t run as fast so uh he / he finds the same pram again uh that Chaplin used earlier and the mother is inside that store again and the old man lays the baby in the pram and walks away and the mother comes out of the store ‘n’ sees the baby again and at the same time Chaplin runs across the pram so the mother uh runs after him ‘n’ beats him up and uh advises him to take the baby again so Chaplin takes the baby again and walks away ‘n’ then he sits down ‘n’ is really uh tired and doesn’t know what to do with the baby and even thinks about dropping it in the sewage hhh or anything uh yeah but then he starts looking in the cloth ‘n’ blankets the baby is wrapped in and he finds a note and the note says uh please take care please love ‘n’ take care of this orphan child ‘n’ now Chaplin really does look at the child ‘n’ starts smiling and cuddling the baby ‘n’ they wander off together
ok uh so uh it’s it’s a it’s a short film uh and there’s uh a a man with a hat on a construction site and at first uh he’s almost hit some some rubble uh and then discovers a baby uh lying on the ground uh ‘n’ he picks it up wonders what happened to the baby or why it is there and uh then he he sees a woman with a stroller uh and he he places the baby in in the stroller next to or opposite of the other baby uh and the woman gets gets mad because obviously it’s not her own baby uh she gets angry at him and then the man / uh yeah the man takes the baby back out of the stroller and wants it wants to place it back on the ground where he found it uh but then is interrupted by uh by a police officer uh / yeah so so the man picks the baby up instead and uh / yeah he walks a little with the baby and then uh he sees another an old man with a walking walking cane and uh he he tricks the the old man into holding the baby for him while uh the the first man uh pretends to tie his shoes uh then he quickly runs way and uh the next minute the old man uh yeah he he tries to / tries to find a place uh where he or tries to find out what to do with the baby hhh and then he sees the same stroller that the woman was pushing before uh he also places the baby in in the stroller uh walks away and then the first man uh walks by the stroller uh by accident uh and in that exact moment the the woman comes out discovers the baby and discovers the first man uh and uh / she I think she punches him or he she hits hits him with he= with her with her umbrella ‘n’ makes him uh pick up the baby again uh xxx the police officer was there too uh and / then I have to think for a moment / uh I think / I think then the uh xxx the first man goes back to the or goes to the street and sits uh sits down on the on the uh / yeah on the on the pave pave no it’s not the pavement / yeah he sits down on the street ‘n’ looks at the gutter uh and I think for a moment he wonders whether he could place the baby into the gutter uh but then he uh looks into the the blankets that the baby is wrapped in discovers a a written a handwritten note uh which says something along the lines of please take care of this orphan child uh ‘n’ that’s when the the man starts to grow fond of of the baby and / uh yeah and I think that’s when he decides not to / uh yeah get get rid of it anymore yeah and walks away
a man walks down a street and uh he’s smoking and uh suddenly someone throws uh their trash out of the window and he loses his cigarette I think and then he goes uh near a trash can and wants to lit another cigarette and uh when he’s done that he throws away his gloves and the uh match with with which he uh lit his cigarette and then he discovers a baby bundled in some clothes and uh is looking up and around and and wonders where the baby comes from and then he sees a woman with uh a stroller and a child in it and he thinks well the child must belong to her ‘n’ so he goes there ‘n’ put the children to the stroller and then the woman comes out uh ‘n’ uh shows that or said that it’s not her child and so he take the child and goes back to the trash can and he wants to put the child down again near the trash can but then the police man comes and uh sees him and looks at him and he takes the child and goes away and then uh he goes a bit round and sees a man another man an older man who’s walking round and gives him the baby and while he’s uh pretending that he is uh tying his shoe laces and while he goes bends down he then jumps up and runs away ‘n’ then you can see the old man uh who doesn’t know what to do with the baby and he goes down the street ‘n’ uh s= sees the stroller again with the baby in it and he puts the baby with the xxx into the stroller and goes away / and then uh the tram uh the man that had the baby before uh walks down the street and the woman comes out of the shop and sees him and before that she saw the baby in the carriage again and she uh xxx takes her umbrella and runs after him and hits him with it and then she drags him back to the carriage hhh and gives hi= uh talks to him and then the police man walks by again and goes to them ‘n’ the woman uh talks to the police man ‘n’ the tram takes the baby again with him and goes down the street quickly hhh and then uh she steps down and uh xxx and uh thinks about putting the baby away somewhere and uh but then she doesn’t do it and she looks through the clothes in which the baby is bundled and sees a note in which uh it’s written that uh please love and care the baby this orphan child and then he / keeps seems to keep the child after that the xxx
ok uh in the beginning of the video clip there’s a man uh walking down the street of some sort of uh shabby looking area or some sort of side street and uh people from from up in the houses are dropping things on him which he is not very happy about uh he then stops uh to grab another cigarette from its box and uh suddenly he notices a baby which is just lying down in the corner next to him crying and uh hhh he picks it up and / is is wondering why the baby is lying there xxx ‘n’ uh in the background uh a woman appears pushing a a pram with another baby inside and uh he probably thinks that she has lost the baby and uh wants to uh return it to her but she uh she refuses and uh doesn’t seem to be missing another child so uh and also she seems quite angry and just runs away so he ends up with the child alone again and uh he then he has an encounter with another man who is rather old ‘n’ walking with a stick with a walking stick and uh then he just he just gives him the baby uh and uh that man obviously is not happy about it either and uh is uh / I don’t know where he goes next xxx I think I think to the main street main road and uh oh yeah I know so the old man with the walking stick uh he finds a a pram which the lady was pushing earlier he finds a pram standing somewhere in front of a shop ‘n’ he just puts the baby inside uh then the lady comes back wondering when that baby appeared from and uh yeah then uh and our protagonist protagonist is walking by the the pram again ‘n’ then she she sees him ‘n’ then just gives him the baby back ‘n’ then and uh after that I think there is a police officer standing observing the situation but he he doesn’t seem to be interested xxx yeah so uh in the end our protagonist from the beginning uh who / ended up with the baby and is not really is is not sure what to do next so uh he decides to sit down on the pavement and uh xxx uh suddenly uh he sees uh finds a paper hidden inside the baby’s blanket and uh / it it appears that it’s an orphan child so he uh feels pity for the child and uh xxx we don’t know how the story ends but uh he will probably take care of the child
