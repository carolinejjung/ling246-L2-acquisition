Charlie Chaplin was walking in the street while he found a baby on the ground hhh he did not know where the baby come from hhh he tried to find it but he did not get it hhh he thought that the solution is giving up the baby to a woman but the woman did not want another another baby another one hhh secondly Charlie Chaplin gave the baby to an old man but he he did not want him hhh the old man put the baby in the same place that Charlie Chaplin did hhh with the woman hhh baby / the woman thought that it was Chaplin again and hit him hhh Charlie Chaplin tried to leave the baby where he found him hhh but a police saw saw him and he couldn't do it / finally he takes care he takes care of the baby and finds a paper hhh the baby is an orphan
hhh first thing we see in this video hhh is Charlie Chaplin walking hhh to a an empty street / well well the street is uh totally not empty hhh because it has a baby hhh left on the floor / crying hhh so after he lighted up a cigarrete uh he took from a metallic box hhh / and he found the baby / and then took him to decided to hhh to try to find a a solution to this problem hhh so he started looking for his mother / uh he saw a woman with a hhh with a baby xxx hhh looking for for something / so he thought / she was looking for the baby hhh so he went up to her and gave out the baby / then this woman started uh shouting him off because it was not her baby hhh uh she seem to be very furious / after this uh the protagonist doesn't know what to do at all hhhh so he decides to left uh the bab= to leave hhh the baby back where he found it and while he is doing this while he is doing this uh see he finds out hhh a policeman is watching him so he takes him back and uh hhh uh walking through xxx streets / trying to find hhh some other solutions / he comes up with the idea of fooling a man / telling him to hold the baby while he attaches hhh his hhh shoe and then he starts running / this women doesn't know / doesn't even know what to do hhh so he found a baby xxx hhh uh in the street with an empty place so he decides to place the baby there / unfortunately this was the first woman hhh car and when Chaplin is walking through that same street / the woman comes off the establishment she was in and then she guess she guesses hhh this is Charles Chaplin trying to fool her again / and this is when she starts punching him and when the policeman comes to the street again hhh so finally uh Charlie Chaplin finds himself hhh again with the baby and on his own hhh so he sits on the floor hhh and starts starts thinking about what to do hhh and that's when he found a paper hhh inside the clothes of the baby that says to take care hhh to take care of that orphan baby
hhh in this video we can see Charles Chaplin walking down the street hhh and while he is walking he finds a baby and he decides to take him / so he didn't really know what to do with the baby so he left it / h= he left the baby with a mum / who also had another baby and when she finds out she got really mad with Charles Chaplin hhh and started to kick him hhh and he had to took the baby back because she didn't want that baby / so sh= he didn't know what to do so he left the baby right where he found him in th= on the floor hhh and when he's putting the back where he found him hhh a policeman realises what he's doing so he got mad at him so sh= he had to take the baby back / 'cause the police thought that he was uh abandoning a baby / so he takes the baby and walks through the street with the baby and hhh he when he sees a man he gives him the baby hhh so he can tie his shoelace hhh and when the man was not looking hhh he started to run so the man was with the baby and now it was his responsibility hhh so the man decides to give the baby to the same mum / Charles Chaplin gave the baby too / so he put it well he put the baby on the baby cart / so when the woman finds out that the baby is again on her baby cart / uh Charles Chaplin was hhh walking right there so she thought it was Charles Chaplin who hhh put the baby there so he s= he said to= she said to him hhh that she didn't wanted her baby so there was also a policeman there so sh= she explain the situation to him and Charles Chaplin has= had to take the baby again hhh / so when he finally had no return he sat on the floor / with the baby and he thought about putting him on a sewer but / he realises that the baby had a message xxx paper / and on his hand he when he reads the message it says that uh he was an orphan baby and hhh that he needed someone to take care and love him so he finally takes the baby and takes care of him
uh at the beginning of this video we can see Chaplin uh walking uh to the camera / 'n' he takes a cigarette box from his pocket and he starts to smoking / and he / he listens to he hears something / and he realize that it's a baby yes on the floor / so uh he the baby's cryin' 'n' he tooks him / hhh and uh starts to walk like looking for someone else / to / give uh for giving the baby to / and uh in that moment appears a lady with a babys' cart 'n' he suppose that the baby is / hers / but she starts to to argue / and uh she even tries to hit him / and uh then he ask to take the baby / 'n' he ask to look for you know for the / hhh the babys' relative / 'n' he starts to walk and uh he kindo find anyone to give uh the baby to so he try to leave him again over the floor and in that moment appears uh / the policemand / a policemand and uh / uh starts to complained about the father he he left the baby aloned on / on the floor and he has to carry the baby againd / and look for someone else so he finds a mand / and he give / he gives the baby to this man / who looks like kind of homeless hhh / and in that moment uh / in that moment uh he starts to run and the policeman uh appears again / and he hhh has to uh / ge= take the baby and / he continues looking for someone else to give the baby to the relative uh to the babys' relative / and uh in that moment he finds uh the babys' carts woman again / and uh he gives the baby to her 'n' / uh yeah it's better he puts the baby on the babys' cart / and uh while this woman is uh is no looking / at him / and then she realize he put the baby again uh on the cart so he / starts to complain about it and she tires to hit him again / and uh yeah he's so uh worrying he doesn't know what / can he do with the baby / so he starts to walk uh carries the baby / and uh he realize he can not uh leave the baby aloned and that is not someoned / uh looking for the baby neither so he sit on over the floor 'n' he starts to look at the baby and he finda a note / hhh saying that the baby is an orphaned and uh please uh / uh he must take care of him because he is as i said he's orphan 'n' he's completly aloned / and that's it
in this video I can see a man uh who is walking on the street and suddenly he suffers an accident / uh she seems to be a little bit clumsy hhh uh then he stops and he wants to smoke a cigarette hhh and in while he is smoking the cigarette he hhh uh he finds a a baby hhh and he wanted to uh left the the baby off / uh firstly he finds a woman and he try to put the the baby hhh into the into the baby the baby buggy hhh uh but uh hhh there's a a policeman who hhh who is uh hhh who is watched him and he can't uh hhh uh he didn't try to go for another place and then he finds hhh a man and he wanted to uh left the baby off again hhh but also uh the police is constantly watching him so / uh he comes and uh finally uh uh he discovers that the woman hhh is in the inside the shop or maybe buying something and the baby buggy is just on the street so hhh uh he tries to put again the baby in the in the buggy in the baby buggy but hhh uh suddenly the woman realise that uh he he is trying to uh to l= to leave the the baby / so finally she decide just to get the baby sitting on the street and then she uh sorry he hhh realise that uh / uh looking looking and the baby uh she uh he realise that uh he has get attached some some= he has develop some relationship with the with the baby
to start with i would like to say that / uh Charles Chaplin / uh goes out of a building / he uh he starts smoking a cigarette / he gets off his gloves / uh suddenly he sees a baby / uh who has been abandoned / by his mother / because uh he's / in it is a poor / a poor place in in a city / uh Chaplin uh takes the baby but he gives i= gives it to a woman / who has another baby / uh / furthermore / uh she doesn't want the baby / uh 'n' Chaplin has to take it / again / uh he gives it this time to a man / who walks along the street / 'n' Chaplin goes out / running / uh the man who has the baby now / uh gives it again to the / women / and / she when she discovers that the baby is again / in the babys' sitter / she runs / towards Chaplin 'n' she starts kicking him / with her umbrella / uh / what's more / she / hhh she tells everything to the policeman / and / Chaplin has in the end / the baby / uh he thinks to / in abandoning / him but he discovers a note / which makes him change his mind / it says that / please / uh whoever who finds him / uh that he takes care of him / 'n' / so to sum up Chaplin / uh / takes care of the baby / and loves him / a lot
in the beginning we can see Charles Chaplin / who has gone for a walk / uh he's about to light up a cigarette but / at the same moment he hears a baby crying / uh he sees the baby and take it / uh the same man he sees a woman who's walking another baby and he thinks that / the baby he had just found belongs to her / that's why he puts the missing baby / on the baby carriage / but / when the woman finds out she gets angry because that baby doesn't belong to her / 'n' after that / uh Charles Chaplin have to take the ba= has to take the baby once again / 'n' he tricks / an old man / 'n' the old man / has to take the baby now / uh Charlie Chaplin Charles Chaplin doesn't want to take the baby hhh so he starts running 'n' hide himself / but the old man / finds the the same woman again / 'n' he / puts also the ba= the baby / in the baby carriage that belongs to the woman but she gets angry / so / in the same woman Charles Chaplin is walking the same street as the woman / and when she finds out that / it's the same / man again / she takes the baby 'n' give it to him / uh finally / he / doesn't know what to do but he finds a note that says that / that ask / to whoever found the baby to love him / and to take care of him and that's why / Charles Chaplin feeld sorry and uh xxx taking the baby
uh I just saw a Charles Chaplin video / he was a really famous actor uh hhh / uh ci= cinema director / and he was known / uh because his videos usually / didn't have any / any / sound yeah music they have / hhh they have music but they don't have any voices or / they were not common / like nowadays / uh so / the plot is about a man Charles Chaplin who finds / a baby in the street / firstly he / took that baby / 'n' he he starts started wondering what he could do with that baby / he / left the little child in a / in a little hhh thing to / put the babies i don't know i mean right now / i just forgot / and the mother of the other baby who had / he uh her own child / uh gets angry with uh Charles Chaplin because she already have one kids / one child and she uh she dec= don't uh she don't doesn't want another / so she said / she says that no i think that she says that / uh to please uh / take the baby away from her / because is not he is not her baby / so he / he's just lost because of he / hhh didn't know what to do with the baby / so he dropped the baby to the floor again but / he's so / he's so sad to leave a baby alone by his by himself / he sees a policeman 'n' he / take the baby / uh like / he knows he's doing something wrong because / he must not leave the baby alone even though is not his is not him baby is not his baby / hhh uh so / he starts / uh spinning around the city / so he finally / sit down / into the street 'n' he looks at the baby / 'n' he's like / oh my god he's so cute but / hhh so he saw a note or the baby well / hhh i think it was not the baby who wrote that note / but / uh so / some people no someone had / wrote written in the ba= in the paper that he is an orphan child / uh please take ca= care of him so Charles Chaplin as a human being hhh has to take care of him / 'n' yeah / my own point of view i think that this kinda of video would be so hard to live nowadays because / now everyone has like an very strict humor / 'n' is going out of hand so / but hhh i think that is a very old humor / so i didn't laugh at all / but it was cute / so / that's what i saw on the video 'n' / yeah / that's all
in the first minute of the video we see some debris falling to Chaplin who is walking through the street / and he is discomforted with this / hidden / walks uh some meters more and more debris / fall on to him / so he ends up / 'n' / shouting and insulting the person who is uh who is throwing this things onto him / he smokes from his cigarette / and also takes uh his packet of cigarettes / and lights / another / cigarette then he takes off his / gloves and / throws them into the bin / and afterwards there is this scene when there is a baby / in / the middle of the street / without no one / he takes the baby and when he takes it / uh he sees a woman with / another baby / in / a trolley / and / he / walks into her and gives the kid / to the woman / thinking that she is the mother of that kid that was abandoned in the street / but / she shouts at him and yells at him / 'n' maybe insults him but / as the film  is / doesn't have / voice with a xxx / but he takes the kid the baby who was / abandon / away from the trolley of the mother / and / runs to put it back when / where / the baby was / but there is a police officer so he / takes the baby again / because he will get in trouble because the / the policeman will think that he's abandoning the baby / although he / is not the father / so then he / goes with the baby to the street sees a man / 'n' / acts like he's going to ties / to tie his / shoes / and / taking advantage of the / of what's he's of what he is doing / he gives the baby to the man / and / runs when he can / hide from him / in order to get rid of the baby / continuing with the video / uh Chaplin / walks / away from where he was hidding / and encounters the lady again with trolley and the two kids because the man / put the baby / the abandon baby / in the trolley of the mother so she / with her with her umbrella / hits him / because she thinks that he has put the baby again / in the basket / but / she hasn't / and when the police officer / comes / Chaplin b= takes the the baby / 'n' he goes away / thinking what to do with him / and then when he was walking in the street he drops his cane / by mistake / and crouches to take it but / at the same time he needs to move the baby in order to / take the cane so he sits / takes the cane 'n' / cuddles a little bit the / the baby and discovers that the baby had / uh a note with /  it that said / that it was an orphan so at the end Chaplin discovers that the baby is not / just / the baby of the woman that he encountered but / uh hhh an abandoned baby so the end / it's / very open / altough we can understand or infere that / Chaplin is / going to adopt the baby and take care of him for the rest of his / life
this is uh an scene of the film the kid of Charles Chaplin / uh it is about Charles Chaplin in the middle of the street / while he's smoking / he finds a baby uh on the floor that might be abandoned by / uh their parents / uh Charles Chaplin decides to / to take him and to find him a place / uh first of all he sees a mother with another baby / and he thinks that / it's uh hers so he decides to give it to her / uh the mother says no to him / so uh he ha= he has to take it again and uh he uh put the baby again on the floor / uh at this time uh a police offir= officer appears / and uh / warned Charles Chaplin that he that he can't do that he cannot put the baby on the floor and abandoned him / and he has to take it to take him again / uh while while he is walking uh on the street with the baby he sees another man and he / gives the baby to him / but this man this man uh put the baby again in the with the / with the baby of the other mo= of the previous mother that I mention / uh so uh again this mother says no this child is not mine so he she gives it again to Charles Chaplin / uh who then uh sits on the floor with the baby and finds a letter / with uh with uh / in which the mother / uh has written that please take care about care with care this baby uh as i= as he if / uh / he was yours so finally Charles Chaplin decides to / keep the baby to him and to adopt him
ok so in the video uh you can see Charles Chaplin uh / walking around the streets / and smoking / and suddenly he finds a baby / 'n' 'n' he also sees a woman with a trolley / so he thinks / uh the baby is uh it's hers / so he goes and put it in trolley / and then the woman tell him tells him it's not / he uh her baby / uh so he tries to put it back uh in the street / but then a police / see him and / and the police thinks uh it's Charles baby and he's trying to abandon uh / the baby so / so he has to take it back / uh then uh Charles see a / hhh a man passing by uh so he he tries to / to fool him 'n' / 'n' to give him the baby while he / he uh / he tries to distract him / uh so the man uh when he sees that Charles has disappeared / he pulls uh put it back uh in the trolley of the same woman / uh Charles uh tried to to put the baby / uh when the woman uh see the sees the baby again in in the trolley uh she thinks that / that Charles uh / put it there / so she finds him and and hit him / so at the end uh Charles end up with the with the baby uh sitting in the in the street / 'n' / 'n' it seems like uh he starts like the baby so / so he keeps / the baby
uh Chaplin is walking / uh on the street and he is smoking / uh then he picks / picks up another cigarette / and uh suddenly he saw a baby / so he didn't know what to do with him / so he saw a mother with a pram / and he tried to put the baby / uh in the pram / but the mother uh saw him / and they had an argument / uh he took the baby again / and he saw a policeman and again he didn't know what to do with the baby / uh so he gave him uh to a homeless man / uh this man / puts the baby uh again in the pram / uh the mother saw the baby so he thought uh sorry so she thought / that Chaplin puts the baby in the pram so she started to run 'n' / hits him with the with an umbrella / and uh Chaplin had the baby again / and uh so he sat on on the street 'n' saw a note / and this note uh said that uh this baby is an orphan / uh baby and uh the note said uh that uh try to love xxx him
ok so / uh Chaplin is uh walking down the street / uh while he's smoking / uh / and suddenly something uh lands on top of him / uh he gets mad / uh / he's briefly stays there and uh picks up uh hhh seems like a cigarette and uh / starts uh he lights it u= up and starts smoking again / uh / then he uh continues walking / uh 'n' suddenly he sees a a baby crying on the street / uh / he takes a look / 'n' looks upstairs / uh looks up sorry / and uh he picks him up / uh / well he doesn't understand what is going on / and he sees a lady / that is uh / hhh pushing a baby bag / and he leaves him there / and well the woman gets mad / uh because it's not uh her baby / uh and he and she tells him to / uh to pick him up again and / and take him with him take him with with Chaplin / uh / then / he Chaplin leaves the baby again on the street / and he's surprised by a police officer / uh so he / picks the baby / up again / and uh starts walking / again uh when he / meets a man / and he / uh leaves the baby with him / so the the man starts chasing him / uh / until these other mend uh finds the as well of the baby bag of the lady / uh and leaves the baby there / uh so / when the lady gets out of a place / she sees it and she sees Chaplin / uh passing by / so she starts uh hitting him with her umbrella / uh / so he has to pick the baby / up again / uh and / and the lady uh / advices the policeman / the police officer / uh so Chaplin finally takes the baby with him / and uh / he sits uh on the pavement / thinks briefly about leaving the baby on a / street hole kind of / uh / but he looks at him and / uh discovers a / paper that the baby / has with him / uh / that says uh to take care of him / uh and love him / so / Chaplin looks at the baby / uh 'n' hugs him / 'n' goes and leaves / that's it
I'm going to talk about / a video is a short story about Charles Chaplin / called the kid / in this story / Charles Chaplin is walking on / by the street on the street 'n' he finds a a small child / that it's abandoned and is laying on the floor / unfortunately / the child is orphan / but Chaplin / pretends / that is not uh / and gives it to a woman that is carrying another baby / in that place he also finds / a man and gives the baby to him / like hey take care of him because / it's supposed to be yours / in a funny way / but in the end / nobody wants the baby because / they have / not obligation to take care of that baby / so it's Charles Chaplin who has to / to take care of him and then / when he's sitting on the floor / he suddenly realizes / that the baby has a note / on its clothes / and / he opens the the note / and it says something like / please / love and care of the child / of this orphan child / so / Charles Chaplin who / who wanted / to get rid of the the baby / suddenly starts to / to smile to the baby / and he's supposed now to take care of him / as it's an orphan kid who has not a place where to live / who has not / a new resources to / to keep on living / alone of course / as he's a kid / so he goes / the Charldes Chaplin goes / with the kid on his arms
hhh Chaplin is walking in walking around the street and uh uh h= he finds that uh a a a man is throwing some stuff over him / uh / when he reach the the end of the street uh then another person uh throws some rubbish over him hhh and he uh tries to to get all the rubbish uh off him / hhh uh then hhh he uh takes out uh a small metal box full of cigarettes and uh he takes out one hhh / to to light it up / uh then he uh takes out his gloves and uh hhh in that moment uh he finds that there is a baby in the corner of the street hhh and he reach to to take him to to see the baby / hhh uh then he decides and he he's going to leave the baby where uh he found it but a policeman arrives hhh and looks at him angryly uh because he can't leave a baby in the street / hhh uh and then he he decides that he's gonna keep the baby and get rid of him at uh at any other time hhh uh / he finds a a carriage a baby carriage and uh he puts the baby there uh thinking that the woman with the baby carriage lost the baby / and the woman complains / uh because uh that is not his baby= her baby hhh and hhh Chaplin has to / take uh the baby again / hhh in that moment he decides to turn right the street / and uh and he finds uh an older man hhh and he plays dumb and he acts like uh he's uh tying his shoelaces / so the older man can uh take the baby / hhh in that moment he runs away / and the man hhh who is confused ta= takes the the baby and puts uh puts the baby in a baby carriage that he sees hhh in the main street / uh and then the woman sees Chaplin and she grabs him / uh by his clothes and take him to the baby carriage sos he take the baby again / hhh uh and and also the the policeman wat= was in that moment in the street uh so / he looks at him angrily and make sure that the baby is / returned to Chaplin / hhh and Chaplin at the end takes the baby and sits uh / in the pavement / he hhh looks at this xxx thinking about leaving the baby there uh as if it was a good option hhh but then he starts cuddling the baby / and uh / uh he finds that there's a note hhh uh in in in the baby clothes and he reads the note / hhh he finds out that the baby is a orphan and so he decides to keep him / and so he stands up and leave happily with the baby in his arms
so to start with / Charles Chaplin is walking by the streets when he finds a baby hhh on the ground hhh the baby is crying and he is alone / so Charles Chaplin takes the baby with him and tries to find the person who left the baby / there hhh / uh the first person he finds is a woman who also carries another baby / and he thinks that the baby may be from her / so he leave the baby with the the other one baby when the other woman is not seeing him / and once he= she discovers that Charles Chaplin left the baby with her baby uh she gets angry and asks uh Charles Chaplin to take his baby / and leave / leave them alone / so what he tries to do is to leave the baby on the ground again / where he found him / but he sees a police officer so he accepts that he cannot leave the baby on the ground / so he tries to do another thing / he founds= he finds a man an older= older than him and tries to give him the baby and he / he pretends to be / to hhh tie his shoe and and suddenly runs / and leaves the baby with the old man / then uh the old man leaves the baby with the woman who had the other baby / because he didn't know w= what to do with with the new baby / and the woman when she founds Charles Chaplin by th= walking by the street again she gets very angry with him she hits him and asks= asks him to take the baby again / so finally uh Charles Chaplin accepts that he has to to keep the baby with him / uh and he finds a letter with him / in the baby clothes that says that says that sh= she or he is an orphan / so he decides to take the baby with him and start a new life with him
uh at first uh we can see Charlie uh / uh walking uh down the street and someone / uh throw trush / uh through the window / and he's upset / so he stop to smoke / and all of the sudden he finds a baby boy or baby girl / and / he's a little bit confused uh cause uh / the baby is crying and he doesn't know / what to do or where this / baby come from and / uh he / takes / him / or her uh in his arms and / sees a woman with a pram and a baby and he may thinks that / uh the woman dropped him by accident so uh / he left the baby / he leave the baby and / the woman uh / hits him and / argue with him / so he / takes the baby back / and / uh / as he doesn't know what to do uh he leaves him in the floor again / uh but a police officer is watching / so he has to take him or her uh again / uh 'n' walk around / so he finds a man / hhh and / uh / ask him to / grab the baby uh for a second while he / uh / I don't know lace his shoes or something and / and he suddenly uh start running hhh away and / uh he hides uh in a place and / then the man / finds the police officer and he reports uh / the baby is there / uh but uh / uh / the baby uh is left in the pram of the woman again / so when Charlie uh sees that uh nothing is happening / and everything / seems to get to come back to normal uh he uh / uh / come out comes out to / from his / uh hidding place and start walking but the woman discovers him again / and hhh / uh / she hits him / 'n' / he doesn't know what to do so he takes the baby again 'n' he drop his cane by accident / uh with the baby in his arms and he sits in the pavement / 'n' start looking at the baby and he finds a note uh that says / uh love and care for this orphan child / uh so he smiles and i think he may / hhh adopt him or is / fine / with having the baby / someway
the video starts with uh Chaplin walking by through a building site and they thrown him some dust and some buildings / like / dust / uh while he was smoking a cigarette and at some point he again gets thrown uh they throw him at him some / more dust over him / and some like building / building remains / and / uh he takes out his like smoking box or cigar box and he's trying to see which one to smoke and whi= which which one is in better shape to smoke it / he picks it out and he lights his uh / the fire with his shoe and turn lights his cigarette / start smoking takes off his gloves throw them off / and he suddenly sees a baby next to a / trash can / he picks up the baby and he starts walking when he suddenly sees this woman with a baby trolley or trolley where he where she has a baby in it / and and he guesses or he thinks that the baby is hers so he put he puts it / there / and the woman sees him and says / you dropped something here and / uh he / he / him and her start fighting and he takes the baby / and puts it back where he found it which is next to the trash can when this police officer sees him he runs into the police officer and he again picks up the baby and start looking / to whom give the baby and he sees this old man with a cane / and asks him if he can hold the baby while he again ties his shoelace / and the moment he pretends that he's / tying his shoelace he he runs off and hides so this old man / while walk while walking through down the street again sees the same woman that Chaplin saw with the baby trolley / and he puts the baby there and he leaves so the woman comes out again from a shop or a house / and again sees the same baby in her trolley and sees / Chaplin passing by so she picks up her umbrella and starts hitting the / starts hitting Chaplin / uh where i guess sayin' to him you again dropped your child in my own baby trolley / and he he was almost to pick up the wrong child but she tol= uh she told him no that's not the one it's the other one so he picks up the baby / uh walks and sits down in a pavement / and starts looking at the baby and one drain opening a sewage and looking through if he he could drop the baby there / but he does not really go through it / with that idea and he close again the sewage looks at the baby and / finds a note sayin' please love / and care this orphan / child so he looks at the baby / and he smiles at him and he stands up and walks / with the baby away while the video finishes
at the beginning of the video it appears a man who is walking on the street while smoking hhh and he suddenly found a baby / he doesn't know he didn't know what to do with the baby so he decided to look for his mother / so he saw a woman with a baby car and he thought that it was her baby / but so he put it into the baby car expecting that it was her mother but it wasn't because she returns the baby to to the man / so / as he didn't know what to do with the baby again / he tried to put it where he found it / on the street / and he couldn't because a policeman came and he had to pick h= pick him up / uh the new strategy that he uses is to found an old man that / uh was walking on the street and he told he told him to hold the baby while he was pretending to tie his shoelaces hhh and he suddenly run away / uh the next strategy that he uses is to hide while the old man gave the mother again the baby / but as he wasn't th= his= her baby / uh he found the the man and thought that he put it the baby cart / so uh the mother hit the man and talk to the policeman so / uh he seems to take of the b= uh of the baby / in the end of the video / as he found a note where he's= wheres it says that uh the baby was an orphan
the video starts with Charles Chaplin walking in the street when suddenly someone in a window throww some bricks that uh almost hit him but he keeps uh walking like nothing happens hhh when suddenly another person throw some trash hhh and this time that person uh hits him hhh and he ge= he gets a bit angry but he doesn't care and hhh start smoking a cigarette / he lights up that cigar but before doing that he takes os= he takes off his gloves and / and keep uh keep his cigar box in his jacket / hhh he starts smoking when s= when suddenly he decides he hears something in the street like crying crying and he decides to look hhh and see wha= what's going on / so he see some blankets hhh and he discovers that there's a baby abandoned in the street so he takes him with him when uh when unexpectedly a woman appears with a carriage and another baby so he decides that the abandoned baby belongs to her / so uh he takes the baby with her but hhh at the end uh it's not her= her baby so she gets angry and fights with him / so he / he have to take the baby wi= the baby with him and what he does is to leav= leave him where he found found where he found it / but uh in the exa= in the exact moment when he is leaving the baby in in the street hhh there's a policeman next to him so he gets a bit scared hhh and has to take the baby with him again / hhh so he keeps on walking in the street when he sees an old man / hhh and gives him the baby / uh with the excuse that he has to fix his shoes / hhh so the old man doesn't have a= doesn't have another option that to take the baby with him hhh while Charles Chaplin hides in another street hhh this old man is running away trying to find Charles Chaplins but hhh in the exact moment he is trying to find Charles Chaplin hhh instead of finding him he finds uh a baby carriage hhh uh this baby carriage is the one that Charles Chaplin found before with a woman / hhh so uh this old man sees uh a baby in that carriage so uh hhh xxx he leaves the the abandoned baby in in the carriage hhh and runs away / in the next scene uh Charles Chaplins uh leave the spo= leaves the spot where he was fi= hiding and sees the policeman so he r= runs away again hhh when suddenly uh he founds the woman uh with the babies again hhh so the woman gets angry when she sees the second baby because it's not her baby / uh so he runs after Charles Chaplin and start hitting him with the umbrella / hhh uh / and they start arguing about the baby when suddenly uh uh appear the policeman and the woman starts / start uh / start starts arguing with with the policeman as well hhh and / and the policeman talks to Charles Chaplin and he has to take the baby with him / so finally at the end of the baby at the end of the video uh hhh he takes uh care of the baby and start hhh looking in the blankets and sees a note uh with with the that the baby was carrying with him uh in the blankets / and the note says please love and care uh for this orphan child so what really happened in the video was that this baby was not hhh really abandoned it was an orphan child so / hhh he doesn't have another option that to take care of the baby / so the final scene of the video is with Charles Chaplin caring the baby and hugging him hhh and even smiling at him so hhh finally he's happy he found that baby
one day / Charles Chaplin is walking down the street / when somebody / throws some rubbish at him / he wants a cigarette so he takes it and he takes his gloves off to get a lighter / suddenly he finds a baby in the corner of the street and he picks him up / he runs to put him in a baby carriage he finds in the street / however / the lady realizes and obliges him to get him back / so Charles Chaplin goes back to the same place where he found the the baby / suddenly a policeman appears and Chaplin needs to get uh to stay with the with the baby / however he finds an old man and he gives the baby to him / and runs away / this old uh man hhh finds the same baby carriage hhh and leaves the baby inside of it / Chaplin goes next to it by mistake as he found the policeman in the other direction and the lady catches him as she realize that the baby was put back inside the baby carriage / she hits him with an umbrella / and he needs to take the the baby back as the policeman is coming back again / after that he sits down with the baby in his arms / and he's thinking how to get rid of him / however he finds a note saying please love and care for this orphan child / so Chaplin keeps him and they go= they both go away together
hhh so the video is about uh Charlie / Chaplin is a video of of him / acting and it consists of / uh / he is walking on the street / when something make the him uh stop / to do / because some things fall from from the roof / and then he see / in the floor / he see a baby / a baby with a with uh / a blankets / so he try to figure out from where this baby come so he thi= / he see a woman with a baby trolley / walking in the street so he think uh that the baby it's hers so he goes to the woman and / and give the baby but the baby is not of her / so the woman shout and maybe / make a scandal / and he / he gives the baby for a while / then uh / a policeman come / 'n' / he try to he tries to leave the baby where he found in the floor / but the policeman uh say what are you doing something like this / take your baby and leave / of here leave here / uh then he finds a man walking on the street and he gives the baby but / and run / and the man / who was given the baby uh / find again the woman / or some i can't remember well uh / ok but in the end the / uh the woman / the first thing / uh was given again the baby but / but after uh Charlie Chaplin was beaten / by her because the baby again was is not of her / so he he take the baby again / he can not the / leave the baby is impossible to him / and / uh at the end of the movie uh / Charlie Chaplin sit on the floor and he discover a note / in a paper / uh so in this note / he sai= uh it says take care of this orphan child / and the movie ends / all nice and beautiful
hi / I'm Paula Montero Jiménez and I'm going to do the oral presentation hhh about this video of Charlie Chaplin / hhh this video is a part of one of the many black and white short films that Charlie Chaplin has been on / hhh uh it is called the kid because the main characters are Charlie Chaplin and a baby he find later hhh but let's start by the beginning of the story / hhh first of all we see a main character walking down the street while he is smoking / then what looks like uh garbage or something like that falls on him hhh so he has to stop to remove the dirt and to light another cigarrette / hhh uh at this moment / hhh uh he turns around and sees a newborn baby on the street corner / he suddenly grabs the baby and takes a look to see if someone is close / and a woman appears just in time with a carriage and he thinks that she could be the mum of this random baby / hhh therefore he drops it in the carriage / hhh however uh this lady start to screaming because it isn't her baby hhh so she force Chaplin to grab it again / hhh later without knowing what to do hhh he decides to leave the baby in the same sport / where he found it before / hhh but a police officer sees him / hhh so as a result uh he had to take the baby again / with him / hhh and tired of this new responsibility and the whole situation in general hhh / uh he sees an opportunity when an old man was walking hhh uh in the street and Charlie decided to set a trap / hhh uh he tells him that he has to tie his shoelace and needs help to hold the baby / hhh so Charlie takes advantage and while this man is grabbing the baby he runs away desperately and hides hhh nevertheless / hhh the old man uh let the baby with the same lady as before hhh and when the woman sees the newbown again / she gets mad / and starts to hit / Chaplin with her umbrella / hhh then she calls out Chaplin while giving him the baby back hhh because the same police officer came / hhh and saw the situation / after all these comings and goings he finally decides to keep the baby with him
Chaplin is walking in the streets when he stops to light up a cigarette and smoke / uh suddenly he finds a baby laying onto ground / uh who is crying / and he tries to look for / the / father or mother of the baby / hhh uh then when a woman appears uh with her own baby he chose he goes after her and he tells her uh that he that she has / dropped something hhh she has dropped a baby because he thinks it's hers / and the lady starts yelling at him because she thinks i th= i believe she thinks that he's trying to abandon his own baby / and so Chaplin goes away and since the lady doesn't wants the baby / uh he Ch= Chaplin tries to / leave him where he found him / but suddenly uh a policeman appears hhh and Chaplin takes the baby again and goes away / uh then when he's walking on the street with the baby in his arms / he finds another man / hhh and he / uh fools him uh he asks him he asks him to / hold the baby while he's tying his shoelace / but instead he runs away with and and leaves the baby with the man / so the man tries to chase after him / but / Chaplin hides and the man is left with baby / so when / this other man is walking in the street with the baby and he finds by chance again the same lady / that Chaplin encounters before / uh and he leaves the baby the abandoned baby in the with the other ladys' baby / while she's not looking / and she he he leaves / then / the woman realizes that it's the same baby and he looks for Chaplin which is the man / who she had seen with th= with th= / this baby / and when Chaplin appears walking on the street she sees him and st= and beats him for / abandoning the baby again / and then the policeman arrives and wondering and he wonders what is happening / so Chaplin just takes the baby and goes away / uh so he isn't finding any trouble / hhh uh so finally Chaplin sits on the ground / with the baby in his arms / hhh and and / he finds a note hidding in the babys' robes / which says / that / please uh take care of this orphan child / hhh and Chaplin suddenly he realizes that he's going to keep the baby / and looks him at him and looks at him in a very tender way
the beginning of this video Charles Chaplin is walking around the city quite non xxx / and / uh is narrowly escaping being hit with rubbles several times / uh he goes into an alley and lights a cigarette / uh finds a kid uh in the floor / uh he thinks that a woman that was passing with a trolley dropped him so he puts the kid in the trolley / but the woman is quite mad at him for putting a child that is not hers in her trolley / so he takes the kid back / he tries to put it back on the alley but the police finds him / and uh he tries to get rid of the kid uh for with these many / ideas as he can he / puts uh the kid in the arms of another man and runs again / but the kid ends up in the trolley again  and the woman makes him take him back / uh in the end / he finds a note scrambled on a piece of paper / inside the many rags that the kid is / uh the kids' is uh / that the kid has around / and / it says uh please take care of this child so he reads the note smiled and finally took the child with him
so in the first scene we see Charlie Chaplin in a very poor area / where it is very filthy dirty / hhh and it seems like hhh the lower class lives there / hhh so while he is walking hhh / he spots a baby crying in the corner / and uh hhh he picks up the baby and tries to look for its parents / hhh and uh he spots a woman uh / walking with a stroller / so hhh he thinks that the baby belongs to hers / but obviously hhh it didn't / and the woman got very angry at him and gave back the baby to him / hhh so later uh Charlie Chaplin proceeds to leave / the baby where he originately found it hhh but fails because uh a police officer caught him uh hhh trying to do the act / so Charlie Chaplin uh picks up the baby again and hh tries to find a solution / so he spots a man uh walking and he gives the baby to him and runs off and hides somewhere / hhh the man obviously upset hhh he tries to find a place so he could / hhh put the baby and he put it in the stroller / hhh where the first woman we saw earlier / hhh Charlie Chaplin leaves his hidding spot and hhh as he is walking hhh the woman got upset with him again / because uh hhh she found the baby in the stroller again / hhh and was complaining it to the police that was behind him following him to Charlie Chaplin hhh so Charlie Chaplin uh didn't have any other choice but to / uh take back the baby / so uh hhh eventually he sits down / hhh and uh he finds a note where hhh the mother says / that please love and care for the orphan child / hhh and / that what he does / so when the last scene he seems very happy hhh and hhh it seems like he is going to take care of the baby
ok so Chaplin is walking down / kind of a sketchy alley / and then he lights up a cigar / and when he starts smoking and he sees a baby laying on the floor / no on the ground / and then he sees a lady with a stroller / and he thinks it's hers / so he puts it in / the stroller but then the lady says it's not hers and then she gives it back to him / so then Chaplin puts it back when he found him uh them / and but then a police officer sees him / and tells Chaplin to pick it up obviously / and so Chaplin then uh walks again down the street and then he sees a an old man with a walking stick / stick so uh he gives it to this old man / and then this old man sees / at the stoller of the lady before / and he puts it in the stroller / uh and then well and then he goes away / and then the lady sees uh Chaplin again passing by the stroller / so she thinks it was him who had put the baby in again / so she starts hitting him with the umbrella / and gives it back to him again / so he / uh he takes it  and Chaplin / uh takes the baby and then he sits / and then he sees kinda fun note / uh in the / clothing of the baby / and then he sa= he he sees a note / where it says uh / that he should take / care of the baby and love him / because it has uh no parents / and then he walks away with the baby / and that's it
Chaplin is walking on the street and sees a 'n' people / are throwing trush out of the window and sees a xxx of the video someone / throws / trush out of / their window and the trush falls on top of Chaplin making him making him drop / his cigarette / so he takes out a pack of cigarettes / that are / half smoked and / picks one up / and takes off his gloves / then he / takes the match stick / and / lights it up with the sole of his shoe and lights / the cigarette with that match stick / and he's looks to the side and see a baby sees a baby / on the floor / in the street / crying / and he looks up / to see if someone has dropped the baby / and / as he's looking up a a woman passes by / with a trolley and a baby in the trolley / so he thinks the baby / that he hasn't / he has he has found is the womans' / so / he / goes after her and / puts the baby inside the trolley / and the woman sees him and scolds him / and tells him to pick the baby / and take it away / so he does so / and / he goes back to where he found the baby / and puts the baby down on the floor / again / but he's meets a police officer / and / he picks the baby up again / and goes away / and as he is walking with the baby he meets a / he passes by a / guy with a limp / and / tells the guy to pi= to hold his baby for him / while he's / uh / he's / pretending to lace / the l= / to lace the lace / to knot the lace of his shoe / and / then when the guy when the guy with the limp / holds the baby / Chaplin runs away / so this guy runs after him / and / as he runs he finds again the trolley of the previous woman / and / puts the baby inside again as Chaplin did / before / so as Chaplin walks by the / trolley again / the woman goes out / and thinks he's the one that has put the baby inside her trolley again / so she goes after him / with an umbrella and hits him / and / makes him / go and pick up the baby again / and a poli=  the same police officer is passing by so / Chaplin is forced to pick up the baby again and take it with him / and as he's walking with the baby in his arms / he sits down on the sidewalk / uh next to a sewer / and he opens up the sewer / in order to throw the baby inside / but he close closes he / again / and as he's looking at the baby / he finds a letter inside the blanket that the baby is wrapped on / in / and / the letter says / please love me I am an orphan baby so he / smiles and takes the baby with him / in order to keep him / with himself
a man portrait by Charles Chaplin / uh is walking down the street / and a pile of bricks falls down / 'n' in his head / uh he lights up a cigarrete 'n' find / 'n' he finds uh a baby boy hhh laying on the street so he decides to pick him up / uh he tries to return the baby to a woman who is walking down the street with her / or / our baby / so / when the woman finds out he's trying to leave the baby with her / she gets angry and / makes Chaplin / take the baby again / Chaplin uh leaves the baby / uh in the same place he found him but a policeman sees him / and decides to have Chaplin has to take the baby with him again / then he tries to fool an old man to take the baby with him and run away / but the old man decided / to drop the baby with the woman / so when Chaplin / appears again on the scene and / meets the woman the woman chase / chases down Chaplin because / h= she thinks / he's / again / dropped the baby with her / so Chaplin has to take the baby / uh Chaplin uh wants to / abandoned the child until he finds uh a note that s= / the woman or the man / the parents of the child sorry uh leaves in the baby saying that please take care of the baby 'n' so / that's what he does 'n' xxx leave
so this video starts with uh Chaplin walking along the street / and uh suddenly a pot of flowers comes from the sky and crashes / in the ground / almost hitting the head of Chaplin / hhh then he takes out a cigarette box out of his pocket / and then uh he tries to light one of them / without success / hhh uh also he sees a baby lying on the ground and he starts looking around to see if someone left him or her / hhh and uh he sees a woman with a stroller and o= another baby / so he takes this uh new found baby / hhh and uh places uh him or her in the stroller with the woman / but the woman starts yelling an= at him / by uh saying that / uh he cannot leave the baby there because he isn't yours= he isn't hers and that / uh so he decides to put the baby back on the on where he found him / uh that is on the ground / but there was a police officer walking around that uh he prefers not to do it because he may get into trouble / then uh Chaplin places the baby in the arms of a / man who was walking along the street with a walking stick / and starts uh running / and hiding from this la= latter man / but then again this uh the man with the walking stick / places the baby in the stroller of the the first lady and the the lady starts yelling once again / at Chaplin / because she thought it was uh Chaplin who put the baby once again in the in the stroller / and she starts hitting him with the / umbrella and end up / then uh she returns to the same place and uh with the police officer walking around / and uh / resigned she= he sits on the= a pavement / with the baby in his harm= arms / and / he realises that the baby has a notes / a a piece of paper uh wrapped in the in the blanket / and the= uh note says that uh he must take care of the baby / well someone if someone finds the baby must uh take care of of this orphan child / and then uh suddenly the face of Chaplin changes and he becomes kinder and uh and holds the baby / uh and starts walking / along the road
uh so the video is a / short story that stars Chaplin / uh it begins with Chaplin uh walking down an alleyway / and uh then suddenly while he is walking someone throws garbage / and it falls on top of him / uh he then procceeds to uh pull out a can of used cigars / and lights one up / uh despite uh it been a bit broken / uh then he continues walking and finds a baby / just lying on the floor / in the alleyway / and he decides to pick it up and as he sees a woman walking with a stroller / he thinks it could be hers / so he puts the baby in the stroller / but the woman is mad / so we can assume that is not her baby / so he then picks the baby up again / and walks back to the place he found it / and tries to put it back on the floor / but he is seen by the police / so he decided= he decides to pick the baby up again / and leaves that alleyway / hhh uh he then finds an old man / and uh he decides to ask the old man to pick the baby while he is allegedly tying his shoes / uh and when the old man grabs the baby / he runs away and hides / the old man uh sees again the lady with the stroller / and puts the baby in / hhh and / uh that woman / sees Chaplin just walking uh normally / and because he / before tried to put the baby in / she gets mad at him again / uh and the police arrives / so Chaplin again has to take the baby / with him / he then arrives uh at a place with a sewer / and thinks about putting the baby in the sewer / but he feels guilty about it / so he sits with the baby / he then uh cuts his finger with a note that is inside / uh the baby's like clothes / and he reads it / and someone asks uh for him or for whoever finds the baby / to love it and take care of it / so Chaplin decides to uh hold the baby / and take care of it / and then he walks away
so in the video Chaplin is walking through old buildings / when something falls on him uh and obviously he gets mad / after this he starts smoking a cigarette and while he's smoking he sees a baby lying on the floor / and apparently it's an abandoned baby / uh and seems very confused but he takes the baby / while he is holding the child uh he sees a woman with a baby trolley / so immediately Chaplin thinks that the baby belongs to this woman / and he goes towards her and when is leaving the baby in the baby trolley hhh uh the woman notices / and she gets mad 'cause it's not her baby / uh again well then Chaplin takes the baby with him and and he runs / and after this uh he goes back to the place where he found the baby hhh and he tries to leave the baby again on the floor but while he is doing it a policeman observes him hhh and he notices hhh so again he takes the baby with him and runs and there is a kind of chase between the policeman and Chaplin / hhh but while is Chaplin is running uh he sees a f= a a a or he finds an old man an unknown old man hhh and basically he gives the baby to this old man and runs / so this person gets confused and and start chasing Chaplin hhh and while he is uh / running he finds again the lady the lady that I've mentioned at the beginning of the story and and he observes that she she has a baby trolley / so this man leaves the baby in the baby trolley and then he escapes / hhh uh hhh well the woman didn't notice about this hhh and when she uh looks again to the baby trolley uh she sees that there is an unknown baby in in in the trolley / basically / uh and simultaneously she finds or she sees Chaplin running / so she thinks that again Chaplin uh was the one who had uh / left the baby there / so they start like arguing / Chaplin and this lady / and the woman punches him and / basically Chaplin has to leave with the baby again / and after this after the chase uh he is exhausted and he sits on the pavement / with the baby / while he is holding the baby / and he notices that in i= within the clothes of the baby there is a kind of note and then he takes the note and and he reads it / and it says something like it's an abandoned baby or is an orphan baby / so / Chaplin feels pity for for the child and / finally we don't know exactly if he adopts th= adopts the child or not but he takes with him / and that's it
in this scene we can see Chaplin walking by as someone hhh throws rubble at him hhh then he continues walking hhh and someone throws rubbish onto him hhh so he stops and looks upwards and starts swearing at this person / then he takes out a tin full of half smoked cigarettes / he takes one / and lights it up with a match / he then takes his gloves and throws them into the bin / then he notices a baby crying by his side so he decides to take a look at him and take him / same time a woman is walking by with a trolley so Chaplin decides to follow her and leave the baby into the woman's trolley / suddenly the woman comes out and starts yelling at Chaplin because apparently the baby is not hers / so Chaplin takes the baby again / when he's about to drop the baby where he found him uh / he bumps into an officer so he decides to take the baby again with him / then he finds hhh a old man walking by so he task him to hhh hold the baby while he ties his shoe but at the moment that he / kneels / he runs away / immediately the old man starts following him but hhh Chaplin hides into a garage and the old man cannot find him hhh so he decides to hhh leave the baby into the woman's trolley / the woman comes out of the store and finds that there are two babies in the trolley / at that time Chaplin is just walking by so the woman takes the umbrella and decides to beat him / with the umbrella / and the officer arrives to scene again / the woman starts yelling at the officer so Chaplin decides to take the baby again and leave / towards he sits on a sidewalk and looks at the baby / then he looks at the drain opens him and thinks about hhh throwing the baby into the into the drain / but he rejects the idea so he closes the drain and takes a look at the baby / while he is touching him he stings his finger with a needle because it was holding a note on the baby's blanket / he sticks the needle into the jacket and reads the note that says / please love and care for this orphan child / Chaplin then takes a look at the baby he smiles so he decides to take all= to take all of his stuff and leave with the baby
