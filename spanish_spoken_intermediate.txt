this video start with Charles Chaplin hhh walking around a street and suddenly someone uh throw= throws him uh some rubbish / uh later she= he uh starts st= to smoke and then uh he saw a baby / hhh uh as he saw a a woman with other baby hhh he maybe think uh it was her baby / so he decide to / give the baby to the woman hhh but this baby wasn't of this woman so uh hhh the woman hhh return the baby to Charles Chaplin hhh / then / uh because of this baby wasn't of Charles Chaplin uh he decide to leave in the same place as he found it for the first time hhh so she leave hhh the baby but a policeman saw him leaving it leaving him / so uh he decide to / hhh to take the baby uh again and then he saw a a man walking / so he decide it was a grea= great idea to / hhh to give the baby to this strange uh man / and he start to run / hhh uh this man uh hhh didn't know what to do with the baby hhh and s= see the the same woman hhh with the / baby carriage and he decide to leave the baby in in that baby carriage / hhh and and she start walking / and then the woman uh appear and see Charles walking uh around the the street / and she maybe thought that again he uh leave the baby in her carriage / and uh she start to fight and a policeman appear and hhh Charles uh take the baby again hhh and uh sh= and he= they uh start to walk to another place hhh / uh she sit down with the baby in the street and she= and he th= thought about leaving the baby in a gutter but then uh hhh he saw a note uh that the baby has / and the note said that hhh uh is a baby without parents that he is alone hhh and please uh who find it hhh uh take care of him hhh so he decide to hhh to keep the baby with him
uh Charles Chaplin was walking in the street and smoking when he found a baby on the floor / so he take him and he try to found his mother / uh he saw a woman who he think uh was the possible mother so he give the baby / but she wasn't the mother so he ca= uh sh= h= she came back the baby / to Charles Chaplin / so he try to rides the baby giving him to a man who / he see in the street / but the baby came back to Charles Chaplin / and he have a lot ot= of problems hhh uh but he finally saw a note that tell the baby is a kid orphan
well / in the video we can see Charlie Chaplin taking his morning walk / while he is smoking a cigarrete / he reach like an alleyway where he finds a baby crying and wrapped with a like a blanket / at first / he thinks that he baby dropped on a woman who was passing by with a stroller / with another baby / but he was the wrong one and that child it wasn't from the woman / hhh so Charlie Chaplin tries to leave him again at the place where he was found hhh but a policeman sees him and thinks they were xxx him / hhh the video continues like this throughout the recording because Charlie tries to get ride of the child / for example by giving it to a man who was passing but somehow the baby always came to Charlie / hhh desesperated xxx the baby left in a sewer like a sewer hhh but thanks god he found a note on the rug / that came with the baby / and writing in the letter say that is in a orphan baby / that bueno then the video ends with Charlie staying with the orphan child
in the video I have seen uh above it uh appear to be a clip from a Charlie Chaplin movie / the protagonist uh Chaplin walking down the street hhh and goes to a place where there is uh garbage and start to smoke hhh while he is smoking he finds an aban= abandon baby hhh and hhh pic= uh pick him uh up / and that moment he sees uh a woman with a stroller hhh and a baby / and Chaplin thinks that the abandoned baby is also the woman / hhh so he follows the woman hhh and place uh the child in the cart / when the woman see him uh she get angry and return the baby to him to Chaplin hhh / so Chaplin doesn't want to take the chid and leaves him where he found him / but a policeman appear so he must pick him up again / hhh uh he keeps uh walking down the street and meets a man / he ask the man to hold the baby for a moment while he ties uh his shoes and then runs away / hhh the man doesn't know to do with the baby and see the woman who appear earlier in the video hhh and he leaves the baby in the cart again / Chaplin uh xxx so that they don't see him hhh and he meets uh the police uh again but he sneak uh away from him hhh while he is walking down the street uh the woman from before hhh thinks that Chaplin has put the baby back in the stroller hhh and when she see uh Chaplin she get angry uh with him / hhh at that moment the police= uh policeman appear and Chaplin has to keep the baby hhh at the end of the video uh Chaplin a= appear sitting hhh on the sidewalk thinking about what to do uh with the baby hhh he finds in the baby uh a note that said uh please and love and care him / and Chaplin in the end decide to keep uh the baby forever
hhh Chaplin was walking on the street when suddenly something falls in him hhh making him drop his cigarrete hhh then he take out another cigarrete from his jacket and he throw his wolves to the rubbish hhh and he sees a baby on the floor hhh he catch the baby and gives it to uh a mother that was on the street / hhh obviously the mother deny the baby hhh and Chaplin tries to leave the baby on the street again hhh but a policeman appears hhh and he tries to give the baby hhh uh to another people hhh among them uh xxx a man and the mother that was in the street before hhh but uh he doesn't get it and finally uh he adopt the baby
ok uh hhh at the beginning of the video uh we can see Chaplin smoking in the street hhh uh when he suddenly sees a baby on the ground hhh and pick its up / uh and this moment uh a woman appear with a baby car hhh and Chaplin uh chase here to return / uh the baby to here / hhh uh the woman uh gets angry and tells him to take it away hhh because that's not her baby hhh uh Chaplin uh decides to returns the baby to the ground / uh but a policeman appear / uh so he picks up uh the baby and leaves hhh uh then hhh uh Chaplin sees an older man / uh and gives him the baby and run away hhh and the older man hhh uh puts the baby in the woman's car baby / again hhh and and leaves hhh uh the woman sees Chaplin in the street running hhh and chase him and hits him with an umbrella hhh and explain to the policeman what's happening / hhh Chaplin uh takes the baby and sits on the sidewalk hhh and hhh and the end of the video uh Chaplin realise that the baby uh has a letter / on his clothes hhh that say something like hhh uh please love and care for this orphan child hhh and Chaplin sad uh decides to take care of the baby / and go away hhh uh that's all I think
uh the video starts with Chaplin walking down a street / under construction uh while he is taking a cigarrete he finds a baby uh lying on the street / at first he thinks that the baby has fallen from a building / but then he sees a woman with a baby carriage / and thinks / that is her baby / he gives the baby to the woman but she get angry because it was not her baby / and then she leaved / uh Chaplin tries to leave uh the baby where he found / but a policeman appears / and he had to keep the baby again / uh then uh he sees a man on the street and Chaplin decides to give the baby to him / but this man put the baby back in the baby carriage of the woman / uh this woman see Chaplin pass and think that he has given her the baby again / so she begin to hit him / uh the policeman appears and Chaplin have to take the baby / uh later uh Chaplin sits with the baby and think about abandoning him again / but then uh he reads in a in a letter that the baby had in his clothes that he is an orphan child / hhh uh Chaplin feel so sorry for the baby / and decides to keep him
hhh first Charlies Chaplin is on a street in a poor hall town he is smoking and suddenly objets fall from above hhh he is amazed and takes out a case where he carries cigarretes and lights one hhh next he throws his gloves in a bin uh when he leaves he finds and abandoned baby crying next to buckets hhh Chaplin tries to look for the parents but he doesn't see anyone so he takes it hhh in those moments an old woman passes with a baby car and another baby / that he thinks he's hers addresses the woman and put the baby in the baby car hhh then they argue and Charles takes the baby and they leave hhh uh next he leaves it back where he found it / but a police see him and xxx it again hhh second when he was walking down the street he sees a man hhh he gives him the baby and ties his shoelaces hhh when he finishes he runs out and hides / then the man leaves the baby in the lady's baby car that Charles has found hhh at first / when Chaplin leaves his hide out he passes scarcely down the street where the lady was with the baby car hhh and the two babies / they argue again the policeman arrives and immediately he takes the baby back and sits on a city walk hhh right next to it is a sewer hhh he grabs it and thinks about throwing the baby over there hhh but realise that the child has a note between his blankets / he reads it hhh finally he thinks that the best things is to stay with the baby and take care of it hhh
at the beginning of the video I see a man / Charles Chaplin who is walking around the street and smoking a cigarrete / suddenly he finds uh a baby on the street / and he picks the baby up / and uh a moment later / he see= he sees a a woman who is uh with a baby car / and he thought that maybe was the woman's / and he returns it to the to the car / but the woman gets really angry because she thought uh he wants to give her the baby / and he= she returns uh the baby to Charles really really angry / uh Charles uh put the baby back uh in the street but suddenly uh a policeman came / and he gots angry because she thought he is trying to leave the baby / there / so uh he has to pick the baby up again / uh then / uh he finds an old man / he gives the baby to him / uh and started to run / the old man doesn't know what to do with the with the baby / so he returns it to a car / uh the car uh is= was of the woman earlier before / mentioned / uh and she finds uh Charles she is really really really angry / and she returns the baby back to Charles / at the moment uh Charles doesn't know / what to do with the baby / he sit with the baby in the street= / on the street / and uh he founds that the= he found that the baby had a note / the note was asking for help and care for the baby / because uh his parents uh / doesn't uh / doesn't have to / money to / grow the baby up / uh so he decides uh he decides to take care of the baby / I think that was that was all
at the beginning there is a man walking in the street / and uh smoking and someone is throwing garbage from the roof and the win= and the window / then this old man sees a baby laying in the floor / 'n' he decide the he decides to take him / uh then he sees / a woman with a baby cart / 'n' he thinks that / the baby might be from that lady so he goes to the baby cart and put the baby there / but once the woman goes / uh / goes there uh to see his babe / to see her baby / uh see uh sees the other baby and this man / so / she goes to this man / and tells him / I mean uh she tells him uh he ta= takes the baby back to him / gives giving back / and / the man / doesn't know what to do so he walks by / and / he goes to the same place where he found the baby and he was go about to put the baby in the floor / but a policeman came / and he had to take him back / 'n' / then he doesn't know what to do with the baby so he sees another man / walking / 'n' he / gives the baby to that man 'n' / start uh running / and then this other man / uh goes by the same baby cart with the lady / who is in a shop / and the baby uh the baby cart is in / is outside in the street / 'n' he puts the baby in the same baby cart / then / the woman gets out of the shop / 'n' the first man who saw the / cart uh the baby / is walking / in that uh street / uh and accidentally the / the woman / uh sees the this man again / 'n' he she wants to / hhh to / give the baby back to him / 'n' she start / starts screaming at him so the a policeman came / 'n' / he has to take the baby with him again / 'n' he goes to the to the street / to sit somewhere / and he takes out a letter / from the baby / from the babys' clothes / and / uh what it says. uh take care 'n' love this baby so / he feels that 'n' he has to take the baby 'n' he finally goes with the baby / with him
hhh Charles Chaplin was walking on the street when he stop to light a cigarrette / hhh and found a baby on the floor / hhh he gives the baby to a woman who has another baby hhh and she uh gets angry with him / so hhh he leave the baby on the floor / put a policeman see him and he takes the baby again / hhh Chaplin tries to give the baby to a man / but the man gives the baby to the woman and she gets angry with Chaplin again / hhh because she thinks that it was / Chaplin who gives her the baby other time / after that Chaplin find a note with the baby that says / please take care of him / and Charles is stayed with / him with the baby

first we can see a man who discover a disisolated kid on the street / uh he doesn't know what to do with the baby because it is / a huge / responsibility to take care / of him / so he decides to get right of the child in many different ways for example to give it to a woman / to a homeless person / then / the man finds a note inside his blanket / that says love me / so finally / uh he decides to xxx him
so the video is about a man / uh whose name / seems to be Charles Chaplin / uh who was walking around the streets when he suddenly found a baby over the floor /  when he saw it / uh he came up with the idea of giving it / to a woman / that was walking / uh around the streets as well / uh but when he / came to the woman to tell her that / that way that baby / hhh / was uh hers / the woman told him that he was wrong / uh that baby wasn't hers / so Charles uh had to get out of there / 'n' finding a new place uh for / that baby /  he firstly believed that the best idea was to place it when he / was found / uh over the floor / but then a police agent uh saw him doing it / so he had to get out of there as well / hhh uh little more later / uh he / found a old man / walking / 'n' he came up with the idea of giving it to the old man / meanwhile he / may do other things or whatever as an excuse / to then uh start uh running from there uh hhh just / giving the child to the old man / 'n' forget about it / uh so he did it / 'n' when he finally get rid of the the baby / hhh uh the old man who now has / the baby / came up with the idea of giving it to the woman / that / Charles found before / so when the woman / hhh uh / went / inside the / hhh an establishment I don't know which in particular / which in particular was the esta= establishment / the old man just leave / and the baby o= over the baby cart of the woman / and then he disappeared / hhh / a little bit uh after uh Charles uh / went though that uh street / where the woman was / and the woman saw him / so h= she thought that the baby that was place it / uh in her baby cart was / uh again / uh / uh hhh Charles business I mean / hhh / that Charles did it / so the woman got upset and he uh started to beat him / then the police agent came / uh / but well after that mess / Charles uh decided to get of of there with the baby / 'n' he finally decided to take a seat in the middle of the street 'n' / when he was uh staring at uh the baby. he realized that there were / there was a paper a card between the clothes of the baby / so he took it / and read it / uh the card says / said / uh take care of that of this uh baby / uh / because / whatever the reason I don't remember / but after reading it / Charles / hhh uh decided to take care / of the baby / 'n' / he got out of there with the baby 'n' I imagine he will go to / his house / to start educating it / to start uh / hhh / being with him
this is the history of a a abandonated babe / that was found by a funny senior called / Chaplin / in a common day this distracted mister was walking around the street when he saw a defendless babe between a pile of trash / he was surprised in this xxx for this / then before nobody relates of the situation he run and he pays / xxx to older man / he knew that he can't be its daddy / just in the last moment / it happened unpredictable / he discovered a brief note inside his cute baby clothes / he read / please / love and care for this orphan child / he was so touched / that became determined that for the / sweet babe
so uh in the video I can see a Charles Chaplin who founds a abandonate baby on the street / hhh Charles see a woman who takes uh twin carriage hhh and he says excuse me uh you drop something hhh and he left the baby in the carriage hhh the woman tells him that he cannot leave the baby hhh in her twins carriage and Charles take the baby back / hhh he tries to leave the baby in the same place where he found / hhh uh hhh but he can left the baby due to the fact that uh there is a police man hhh so he has to take the baby with him / hhh later uh he ask a elderly man to takes the baby / for a moment and he runs away / hhh uh the elder= uh the elderly man meets the the woman and take the baby in her twin carriage / hhh Charles meet the woman again hhh who hits him with an umbrella and gives the baby back to Charles / hhh in the end uh Charles uh has to keep t= uh the baby

hhh we see a video in which Charles Chaplin is a homeless man and he's walking on the street / and then something hits his head / and when he's looking down at the floor he realizes there's a baby crying / next to a paper bin so uh he picks it up / and he suddenly sees / a woman that's uh carrying a baby cart / and he thinks the woman dropped uh her baby so he tries to put the baby inside the baby car / but the woman tells him it's not her baby so he has to take it back / uh then Chaplin doesn't want the baby so he tries to uh abandon him / uh where / it / was before / but a policeman appears and / uh looks at him / and Chaplin realizes that he cannot leave the baby there / hhh so he tries to get rid of the baby and he sees a man / and the man uh is walking and Charles uh approaches him / and uh tells him uh that he needs to tie his shoe / so that the man / uh holds the baby and he can run away and he does but then the man uh f= uh encouters the woman again / the woman with the baby cart / and / hhh he uh leaves the baby in the baby car and then Chaplin appears next to it and the woman thinks that Chaplin has been the one who has left the baby there again hhh and hits him with an umbrella / and the policeman appears again and makes Chaplin take the baby / Chaplin uh thinks about abandoning the baby again but then he / hhh he injures himself with something sharp / and he realizes it is a note in which it says to care and love for the orphan child / and so Chaplin pitties the baby and takes it / with him
at the beginning of the video  we can see Chaplin walking down the street / 'n' / when suddenly someone throws some debris at him / uh he takes out / a cigarette and he lights up a cigarette / 'n' when he notices that a baby is laying in the ground / he picks up the baby / and he looks around to see if someone's on the street / when she when he sees a women / walking near him / he with a baby carriage / he / goes / near the women / and he / uh he drops the baby in the baby carriage / but the woman uh asks him to take him out / and / uh go away with the baby / uh when he's trying to / hhh drop the baby again on the ground he / notices that a policeman is / looking at him so he picks it up again / then he sees an old man and he aks / he asks him to to pick up the baby / uh and when the old man picks up the baby / he runs away / and he escapes / uh the old man / leaves the baby in the baby carriage / of the women of the woman we saw at the beginning / and when the woman notices that the baby is on her carriage / he looks uh on the street to see if Chaplin's over there / and when he sees him / when she sees him / she ta= she / hits him / she hits Chaplin with the umbrella / then Chaplin uh picks up the baby again / and he uh he walks down the street with him / until he sits on the pavement / he's looking at the baby to see what / what can he / do what he can do with the baby / hhh uh when he notices that / the baby has a note / hhh probably written by his mo= by the mother of the baby / or by the person who dropped the baby / at first place on the ground / uh the note / said that uh the note ask the person who / find the baby to please take care and look after / him or her / because he's he or her is an orphan child / hhh and at the end of the video we can see Chaplin pretty happy with the baby / and it seems like he is gonna take care of him

hello / I am going to talk about what I have seen in this video hhh / I can see some people / there is a man who is wearing a hat and he is walking and smoking in the street hhh there is another man who is in a building and he sees the other man from a window / hhh I think that the man who is in the window is cleaning his bedroom / and he starts throwing some things in the street / hhh these things fall down on the man who is smoking hhh but he doesn't know where this thing come from hhh so he continues walking hhh then he takes a little box from his jacket and he start searching for a cigar / he sees a little baby in the street and this baby is crying / the man is looking in the street and to the building hhh because he doesn't know who the baby belongs to / there is nobody in the street hhh so the man takes the baby to carry with him / when he takes the baby he sees that a woman is in the street / and she has a baby car / so he tries to call her because he thinks that the baby belongs to her / hhh this woman enters into a building / in the car there is another baby and the man is going to leave there the baby hhh but the woman leaves the building and she is very angry because the man is leaving the baby with the other one / hhh this man doesn't know what to do with the baby that he has found in the street hhh and he thinks that a good solution is to leave the baby in the same place hhh that he was when he has found him / but when he is going to leave him there is a problem / and a police officer appears / hhh so he has to return to this place and take the baby again / the man starts walking in the street hhh and gives the baby to the other man and start running / the man who has the baby now finds the same car with the baby that the other man has found before hhh so he leaves the baby there and start running / hhh the first man leaves the building where he was hidden and find / the police officer again / so he start walking in a different way / the woman who has the car with the babies was in a different building hhh and when h= she leaves she realise that in the car there are two babies hhh and the new baby is the same that was before sho= so she gets angry again / hhh at this time the first man is walking in that street / so the woman starts running to catch him because she thinks that the baby is in the car because he had left the baby there / hhh now hhh the police officer appears again so the woman starts saying all to the police / hhh the man takes the baby with him and walks in the street / he sits in another street with the baby and sees that the baby has a lit= a letter hhh into his clothes / the man gets the letter and reads it and this is moment when the man starts loving the little baby
in this video we can see Charles Chaplin walking across a building site smoking a cigarrete / hhh while he was trying to avoid bricks that fall from the building / when he found a baby crying on the floor / so he decided to pick up the baby for look for hers mother / in that moment a woman pass near him / and that woman has another baby / hhh uh so Chaplin thought that's her baby / and put him on the on the pram from the woman / hhh the woman angered said that xxx= that's not her baby and Chaplin get back the baby where he found / hhh after that a policeman saw how Chaplin drop the baby and he take the baby back with him / hhh later he let a ancient man who decide to give him the baby and run away / hhh the ancient man didn't know what he can= could do / so / like she saw the same pram as before and put the baby hhh Charles Chaplin uh thought uh leave him the baby hhh because the woman show the police hhh and the denies to Chaplin / because she / not like the= that baby / hhh when Chaplin got the baby he don't know what she should do / she should do with that baby / so uh finally / he found a cart on the baby / and he can read / please love and care of the orphan child / hhh in the video / the child / is / poor and Chaplin / rich
uh this video is about a / a man who is Charles Chaplin / and he is walking / uh in the street when she when he finds a baby in the middle of the street / and he / picks him up / but he uh he doesn't know what to do with him / and / he s= he continues walking / and he sees a / a woman with a baby carriage / so he thinks that maybe the baby is is hers / so / he gives the baby to her but / uh / the wom= the woman says is not hers / uh / she has like a very angry face with a serious expression / so Chaplin / uh takes again / the baby / and he comes back to the same street and he / leaves the baby in the same place but when he / turns around uh he sees a policeman / who is uh / watching him / uh with a with also with a very serious and a strict face / so Chaplin uh takes again the baby / and when he comes back to the to the street / he sees another man / and he leaves the baby to that man / and he runs / he runs away / but / hhh the the new man uh doesn't know / what to do whe= with the baby / and when he's walking he sees the same baby carriage than / the previous time / and he leaves the baby uh in the same baby carriage like Chaplin / the mother who is in the middle of uh who is inside uh / uh shop / uh the mother when when she / uh comes out the / uh the shop / uh / she sees that / there is again a baby in her baby carriage so uh he sees Chaplin that is walking in front of her and she thinks that / uh Chaplin has left again the baby in his baby carriage / so uh she / says to him / that / that baby is not hers and she explains the situation to a policeman / uh now Chaplin takes again the baby / and now he doesn't know what to do / uh he has / tried everything / so he / uh sits in / in a pavement / uh with the baby and when / when he's thinking what to do / uh he sees a note in / in the middle of the blankets of the baby / 'n' 'n' the note says please love and care / uh for this orphan child / and this is the end of the video
well in this video / we can see / that / Charlie Chaplin is walking across a street / when suddenly / some rubbish is throw to him / hhh / then / he look to the floor and / h= he see a a baby / that is uh xxx maybe he is / he had been abandon / leave here by he / uh her his mother / uh behind Chaplin we can see / a a woman who is with / her baby / so / Chaplin thinks / that / the baby that he ha= that he had found may be / also / b=  uh this mothers' baby / so he go to uh with the baby / and give it to the mum / but it / is look like is / it isn't his her baby so / he gets so angry and give it back to Chaplin / he / uh now / Chaplin trying to uh get away with / the baby / so he tried to put it again where he ha= where he found it / but a a police officer / appears / so he have to run away / uh while he's / hidding from police / he found another man and give it the baby to him / and suddenly / uh / run / this man / also found uh the same mom / that Chaplin found / so he / give the baby to the mom / and run away / but he can't / make it / uh xxx mother and the mom doesn't find out that / the baby is from other man / so when suddenly / Chaplin appears again / the mom thinks / that uh baby maybe / uh that the Charlie did it again and give it the baby to him to her / uh Charlie try to explain to her but / the police officer appears again / so he have to uh take back the baby / uh / finally he / arrive / where / the / xxx / uh he sit on the floor / with the baby / uh start to uh / look carefully carefully into uh / babys' clothes / there / he found uh a note a letter / made from uh babys' mom / where / she said that / the baby is a poor boy 'n' someone have to take care of him / uh so uh in this part uh with no word Chaplin / hhh look / lovely to the baby / uh decide to take care of him / uh then he get up 'n' / go walk
uh so in this video uh the first person we see is / Charles Chaplin / 'n' he's walking / uh around the street / when / s= / when a women / drops some rubbish / uh over her / over him / 'n' / he keeps walking he he's not dis= he's not disturbed / and / suddenly another person drops / drops more rubbish over him / and he / gets upset / so / he / he lights / a cigarette / and / suddenly he found a baby / an abandon baby / uh / well he catches he catches him / uh he / when he turned / he saw a women / with a double baby / cart / and he thinks that the baby probably belongs to this women / but it's not / but he / he's wrong the this baby doesn't belong to the women because when he puts the baby / in the cart / uh the women / the women says / that Chaplin must keep it / could must keep him / cause it not hers / so while he / he keeps walking with the baby on his arms and / he found another homeless just like him / walking around the street / 'n' he tries to / to to give the baby / to this homeless / 'n' when / when this when this homeless uh tries to realize what happened Chaplin is not here / is not there / uh / 'n' the homeless keeps looking for Chaplin and / he finally finds the car / th= he / he dropped the baby on the cart / 'n' / Chaplin / appears on the scene / when the women leaves / this store it seems to be a store where / where she is / uh sees Chaplin walking / walking around the street / 'n' she gives / back the baby / 'n' she gives the baby back to Chaplin / and he / he's desperate cause he doesn't known / who / who the baby belongs to / uh 'n' / h= i think he's more desperete cause / if he have / if / Chaplin have / haven't enough money for him / less money for the baby / uh / and suddenly / when he / while he's / waving the baby on his arms / he finds a note / that says / that the children that the child / uh is an orphan child / so / it's real thirsty / it's / really sad a really saddy story / cause / it's an abandon baby / 'n' / uh probably Chaplin / Chaplin / couldn't get / couldn't afford to take / take care of him
Charlie is uh walking to a xxx neighbourhood / when he decided to smoke a cigarette / and he looks down and he discovers a baby it was a baby / who is crying / then he decides to to return him to / his / supposed / mother / and he discovers a woman who is uh passing uh around his baby / in a trolley so / he thinks that he might be his well her her child / he puts the baby in trolley and the woman says that he he wasn't her baby so / he she may Chaplin take care of him again / so / after that Chaplin uh / uh goes towards a new man / who holds the / the child / into his arms and Chaplin runs away / so the old man uh confus= confused and decides to put the uh child / in the same trolley again so when Charlie Chaplin uh uh passed by uh that trolley again and that woman sees him / she hits him with her umbrella and make him to take the / baby back again / so he uh decided finally to uh / left the baby in the same place he found it but a / a policeman / uh see him and sees him and him as uh take care of the baby / so after that uh desperately uh / he is thinking in leaving the baby in the sew= in the sewer of the street of the streets and / when he decides not to do that he discovers a letter / in which uh it is said that / that baby was an orphan and the one who uh found him must take care of him and love him so Chaplin uh decides to to do that and take care of the baby
there is a man walking in the street / and some people are throwing garbage and / some other things / through the window so sometimes he has to stop / to uh not to be / beaten with this objects / so hhh he stops / and / takes a cigarette / uh from his cigarette box / and / he removes his gloves to light it / uh when he is smoking / uh he realizes that there is a baby / on the ground / and he takes the baby / then uh he sees that there is a / mother with his child / and she's carrying a pram / so / he puts the baby that he has found on the ground / in that pram with the other baby / then the mom yells at him because the baby isn't hers / and he takes the baby again with him / he was going to put him to put uh the baby on the ground again but he realizes that / he has a policeman uh / near him / so he doesn't do that / uh then he keeps walking in the street / and he finds a a man / wa= uh so he gives the baby uh to this man / with the excuse that uh he was going to tie / his shoes / but uh he runs away without the baby / the second man puts uh the baby in the previous pram / because he finds he finds uh he finds / finds sorry this pram again / 'n' he walk away also / but the first man is passing by again / and the mom sees that the baby is again in / her pram with her baby / so he takes an umbrella / and beat and and she beats the / the first man because she thought / that uh he put / the baby again in the pram / so the man takes the baby again from the pram because there was a policeman there / and he keeps walking in the street he sits in the street with the baby in his arms / and he realizes that there is a note / uh that says / uh please love and take care for this orphan child / so the man smiles at the baby and walks away
hello my name is / Miriam Marín Moreno and I am going to talk about / uh Charles Chaplin video / hhh uh Charles Chaplin is having a walk when he's find an abandonated baby / he takes him and he sees a lady with another baby / in a pushchair / and when she was distracted / uh looking for something / hhh Charles puts the baby on the pushchair but the lady notices and she get mad / hhh then Charles take him again and tries to put him back where he is found / but / a policeman sees and Charles take de baby again and leave / hhh / Charles find an old man and give the baby to him / hhh then the old man finds the lady with her pushchair hhh alone and puts the baby there / hhh uh then he leave / hhh uh Charles appears in that's moment / and the lady xxx him / and the baby in the pushchair hhh again hhh and gets mad with Charles / hhh uh once again Charles take him and then leave with the baby / he sits on the floor / with the baby in his arm and thens he sees that the baby has a note / and reads / in the note / was written uh hhh please love and care for the orphan child / hhh then / Charles decided to keep xxx / to keep it sorry hhh
ok so this uh scene belongs to a film by Charles Cha= / by Charles Chaplin called the kid / 'n' at first / it shows uh Charles Chaplin going for a walk and smoking a cigarette / uh / and she finds he finds a little baby next to a trash bin / 'n' he decides to to look for him mother / so he finds a a woman carrying / a baggie with a baby on it / so put / so he puts the bab= the abandon baby / on it thinking that he's / she's her mother / but / the this woman is not the mother of the kid / so she gets angry with him / and Chaplin decides to put the baby where he found it / him / uh while he is putting the baby next to the trash bin a a police officer appears / so / he has to / to to carry the baby with him / uh then he continues walking / and sees a man an old man / and he thinks that it's a good idea to cheat him / uh while he's uh tying his laces / uh leaves the baby with that old man / and run away / but uh then the the old man / uh doesn't know how to do with the baby / so / he finds a a baggie / uh next to a shop / and decides to put the baby on it / it's the same baggie that / uh Chaplin at first saw / so the woman thinks that / the person who puts the baby was Chaplin / and see and sees him / uh next to the baggie so he again gets angry with him / uh so Chaplin decides to carry the baby with him / and realizes that the baby is wearing / is wearing a note / uh that says please / uh love and care this / orphan child / so that's softens him / and decides to / to keep the baby / with him / and take care of him
uh in this video we can see uh a famous actor called Charles Chaplin / and uh we see a story / uh about a orphan kid and / uh Charles Chaplin / uh in this story we can see how uh at the beginning Charles Chaplin is uh walking through the street and / f= then suddenly he discovers uh a baby and uh in a corner / and uh / dec= decides to take him / uh / when uh when he sees a police man uh approaching to him / he decides to to leave uh the baby in uh in a baby carriage with a with a woman / but when the woman discovers that he is trying to / to drop the the baby in uh in her carriage / uh she gets angry and uh gaves gives the the child uh back to Charles / so Charles again have the the child / and uh / it seems that he's thinking / uh where he can leave the baby again / uh / then uh / it appears like uh a homeless man with long beard uh so Charles decides that maybe he could be a good option to hhh to leave the child with / so uh he decides to to take the child to the sa= to this man / and then Charles Chaplin uh runs away / uh when uh when the man uh takes the the child uh as he doesn't know what to do with him so hhh the baby he sees the / the woman with the baby carriage again through the street and again uh he decides to to leaves the child with the baby carriage / uh and the girl who was in a shop / uh when she discovers again that the child is uh in the baby carriage / uh / she start to uh she starts to shout and to call Charles Chaplin again / uh she gets angry and uh gives the baby the baby back to Charles again uh so it's like a / finally Charles uh always uh ends up with the child in her in his arms / uh finally / uh with the with the baby on his arm again / uh he sat down in a in a in a curb in the street uh and hhh he looked at a at a drain / like as if he was going hhh to to put the baby in the street drain but finally / uh looking at the baby he sees realizes that the baby has a note with him / uh a note that says uh that it is a poor orphan baby so / finally he feels like sorry for the baby and looks at his eyes and feel like uh feels like a / feels so sorry for him finally he decides to to take the child with him and we don't know if uh finally he's going to to look after him or whatever but it's a very funny / story / uh and uh that's all
in this video we see the protagonist who is Charles Chaplin / he is / uh walking in the street / but he suddenly sees a baby / who is drop in the middle of of the street / so he decides / to / carry him / but then / he / he sees a woman / who is also carrying another baby in a baby trolley or something like that / so Charles / decides to / put the baby with the other one / because he / he thought / the baby was / uh of her of hers / but uh the woman notice that uh she / gets mad at him because of course it was not hi= her baby / so Charles Chaplin had to / carry again the baby uh / get it with him / in the street / then uh / he s= he sees another man who is / maybe a beggar or something like that / again walking in the street 'n' Charles / uh decides to give the baby to this man / but the this man is also confused because of course the baby is not him / so again / we see this man / that / gives the / the baby to the same previous woman / because of course uh he thought it was of h= of hers / but / then the woman / uh sees him while the woman that didn't know that / this / the baby was dropped there by the second man but she thought instead that it was Charles Chaplin who did this again / so / at the end uh the woman / sees Charles Chaplin and / and gives him the baby / because / of the confusion / uh but finally / uh / Charles decides to carry the baby / he sits in the middle of of the street and sees that the baby is carrying a note / the note says that / uh well to / to love 'n' / care / me / as the baby was saying that / so at the end Charles uh takes him 'n' / i guess he is pit= he fee= feels pitty for the baby and / and is going to take care of him
the video starts with / Charles Chaplin / who is walking / in uh through a neighborhood / and when he is going to take out one of his cigarettes / uh he suddenly notice notices that a boy is laying / on the ground / the baby it's a baby / and / uh as a woman is walking by the street / uh he thinks / that / the baby belongs to her / so / sh= he decides uh to / uh bring the baby to that woman / however / uh the baby / it's not hers / and / the woman / reacts angrily when she finds out that Charles Chaplin has landed the baby / on her trolley / uh then / Charles takes the baby and / proceeds to leave it in the place where he had found it / uh nevertheless uh he encounters a policeman / 'n' / he fears that he go to / something bad to him like / making him pay a fee or something like that / so he / then decides to take the baby / and and find another solution / uh as / he walks down a street he finds a man / uh who is really old and / who's uh / who is uh who finds it difficult to walk / and somehow uh and Charles uh / tells him to hold the baby / uh for him for a second / and that allows him to run away quickly / leaving the baby with the old man / uh the old man / uh / finds out / what / uh Charles aims to do / uh and he runs with the baby to give it back to him but he uh he doesn't found Charles / however he finds a trolley which belongs to the previous woman / and decides deci= decides / uh to leave the baby there / uh meanwhile Charles is hidding in the place where he found the baby and when he uh escapes from the place where he was hidden / uh he uh encounters again / uh the same policeman uh he had previously / uh met / and he / uh runs away quickly again / uh when while he's running away / he / uh meets with / uh the the woman who was carrying the trolley / and / uh the woman realizes that she's / carrying the baby again / and so / uh she / is / again / uh really angry / uh makes Charles take the baby again / as a result / uh Charles uh tries to find a solution and takes the baby to a place where is uh calm / and / uh suddenly uh he finds a / a small piece of paper where / it is written / something like please love and / take care of this baby / and / uh that is how Charles realizes that uh he has to take care of him because he is an orphan / and he really needs that love and care
at first we can see Chaplin walking around a street which seems to be under construction / and suddenly some neighbor uh throws some rubbish throughout the window / and it falls / on Chaplin / and he finds a metalic box with / cigarettes / and then he steps into a bin / and some of the rubbish which was in the bin / falls / to the floor / and when he turns around he sees a baby laying on the floor 'n' crying / and he takes it and he suddenly sees a woman who is walking around / with another baby so he thinks that she might be / his mother / so she / so he uh tries to give it / back to her but / it's it turns out that she's not the mother / so he takes again the baby with him / and he starts walking uh after that he finds a man / who is not able to walk quickly / so he gives the baby to this man / and he starts running / but uh finally he has to take the baby again because / he sees a police officer / uh he uh starts walking around he's now in another street / and he sees again the / first woman / with the baby but this time uh the woman is not there with / her baby / so he tries to leave / the / the baby he had found with the baby of the woman / but / that woman sees Chaplin doing that so he starts hitting him with an umbrella / and the police officer appears again / so he's desperate he doesn't know what to do with the baby and he sits down on the street / and he starts looking at the baby and playing with him / and i think that he just started to feel / love and / maybe he is worried about him and he finds a letter between the layers the coat of the baby / which says asks for love / and love for the baby so he goes with him / and I think that he finally / keeps it /  keeps the baby with him
so at the beginning there is some man who is strolling around the the road / uh was trying to avoid / the waste that some neighbors are throwing / and he listens a a baby crying / uh he takes / him and tried to tries to give it to a mother / uh young woman who is / strolling around the road / but she refuses to take care of him / so he tries to give it to another man who is using a cane / and that man uh gives / give give the baby to the woman ag= again / and uh she's / sees uh Chaplin / and uh and gives / give the baby to Chaplin again / so Chaplin wants / wants to get rid of the baby / but he reads a note where someone has written / uh some some / hhh / some words / uh asking / uh people / to take care of / the child / so at the end we can't imagine that Charlie Chaplin will / take care of the child
I am going to make a short summary / about the story / uh the story is called Charlie Chaplin the kid / uh it is about / a man who / uh run into a baby / in the street / and he was walking / uh 'n' suddenly / he find he found sorry / in the on the floor a baby / so uh he / uh take it / uh he try to / leave in other place he look everywhere / but uh so this is uh when he didn't uh look after the child / this child / so uh he / saw a mother with a baby carriage / and he uh wa= he wanted to leave the the baby / uh in this carriage / uh so the hhh mother / uh noticed that uh and she was angry uh because of that / so uh Chaplin uh had to take again the baby uh / and he uh / walk uh with the baby in their armed / so he also / uh found a policeman / uh and the police uh this policeman was looking hhh at his movement his movement / uh Charlie uh / uh / i have buena in addition to that / at at the end uh Charles Chaplin / uh wa= Charles Chaplin / uh look after the child / because he didn't find any anybody to look look after of it / so uh he decide to love / 'n' the baby / well that is all
there is a man walking on the street when he suddenly uh sees a baby / crying on the floor / uh s= he sees a woman with another baby and he thinks that / the baby is also hers / but i= / is not her baby / he tries to get rid of the baby some more time but he doesn't succeed / finally when s= uh he doesn't know what to do with the baby he finds a paper / inside the clothes of the baby that / said / uh that in what / someone ask to / ask to take carv= take care of the baby / so the man finally decides to keep it
there is Chaplin walking / on the street / and / uh he is suddenly is thrown some rocks / from from a flat / and / then he / he starts smoking a cigarette / and / he sees / a baby on the street / he he takes it / and / uh after that he doesn't know what to do with the baby / and / firstly / he tries to / to leave it on a pram / from / uh from others other woman / uh and then he / uh the woman doesn't doesn't want to have the baby / inside her pram / because / uh it is not hers / she has another baby / and then / uh / he tries to / to / ah he tries to place / place the baby / again on the street / but suddenly a policeman appears and / and / uh he says to Chaplin that he cannot do it / so then / Chaplin finds a= another man and / he he tells him / that / uh to keep to keep the baby for a second while he's doing something / but he runs away / and the man with the baby / sees the pram of the of the previous woman / and leaves the baby there / hhh so the the woman / uh the woman suddenly sees Chaplin again hhh and thinks / that he did it did it again / so she gives the baby to Chaplin / and / and also the policeman appears and / so Chaplin is finally with the baby again / and he sits down / uh the street / he sits down and he's with the baby in in his arms / and he he / uh he sees a note / who who tells that the baby is orphan and it says him to take care / of him
Chaplin was walking on a construction site / uh evading some debris / until he eventually gets hit by some / so he gets angry and tries to light a cigar / he takes out his gloves / uh lights a match and eventually lights the cigar with it / so he when he was walking away finds a baby laying on the floor / and he picks it up / and sees a woman with with a stroller / stopping by so he thinks that baby may be hers / so leaves the baby on the stroller / uh afterwards the woman comes out / and sees Chaplin with doing that / so she gets angry with him and tells him to take it away / Chaplin tries to take the other one hhh so the woman gets even more / angry / and so eventually Charplin has to take the baby the baby away / he keeps walking down the construction the construction site / and tries to leave the baby where where it was previously but he is seen by a policeman / and then he has to take the baby again 'n' walk away / he finds / a man / and tries to he tells him to hold the baby as he ties his shoes and uses that to run away / from it and hide / the woma= the man tries to follow him / but he couldn't find him so / while he gets walking and find this stroller / leave the baby there and run away / woman got uh sorry uh Chaplin comes out of his hideout / and the woman finds the baby / that wasn't hers in the stroller / as walking wa= as Chaplin was walking by / so she / hits him / with her umbrella / and / urges him to take the baby away / the policeman arrives hhh / with with the two of / with those two arguing over the baby / so Chaplin has to take the baby away again / he sits on the sidewalk / tries to or at least thinks of throwing the baby on the sewer / uh but he finally didn't do it / he finds a note in the baby saying that it was an orphan / so he he pities it / plays with it and eventually he walks away / taking it home with him
good morning uh today I am participating / in a project about uh / english usage uh they have shown me a video / uh about uh Chaplin / in the twenties and / it is a mute video there isn't any kind of sound / uh / and the video / uh / is about / uh Charlie Chaplin / who is uh walking through the street / uh one day and then / uh suddenly he fi= he finds a baby on the ground and / he doesn't know what to do with with it / uh / also / uh he took it / and and tried to / to give it to a woman who is passing nearby / but the woman gets very angry with with him / and / and he hit her / uh he and she / gave it back to to him / uh after that uh he he tries to to find / a= another / another way to to get rid of the baby because he he doesn't know what to do with him and h= and finds a beggar in the street and gave it to to him as well / and / af= after that he he runs away / but he is very unlucky and it's seems that the beggar uh take the baby to the woman he uh passes uh the the first time / uh after that the Cha= Chaplin / coins= coinside with with the woman again / and the the woman blame h= blames him for for that / hhh / and uh also in the middle of the video I remember the= there is a a policeman / uh that catches h= uh Charlie tryin' to to put the baby on the ground again / but uh / he uh as he doesn't want to be punish uh he / take the baby again / uh in the final scene of of the video Charlie Chaplin is sitting on the ground with the baby / but uh surprisingly uh he uh finds a note uh with the baby uh which says that uh the baby is an orphan / and and then Chaplin smiles a= as he knows that / uh what to do with the baby / he so he stands up and and go to the orphanage / so / that's mostly / the point of of the video and / just a resume / of it / thank you very much
well / at first / we come across with the character of Charles Chaplin which I may assume it is a vagabond since hhh he is wearing mittens hhh and he is walking through an alley / which seems to from the suburbs or something like that hhh and and some uh garbage through / well some= somebody threw some garbage away hhh and it fells hhh uh over this character and / afterwards this person is trying to to smoke and he finds out a baby and this baby basically is an uh an abandoned one hhh uh Charles Chaplin doesn't know what to do with this baby so he basically he he sees hhh a woman with a pushchair hhh and and he tries to dispose this baby in this by putting him in this in this pushchair hhh finally the lady basically uh finds out that he is trying to get rid of the baby and uh she told off uh Charles Chaplin hhh and afterwards this scene we see again Charles Chaplin with the baby hhh and and and trying to / get rid of him by putting him aga= again in in the same place that he found out hhh but a police officer appears and basically / he cannot / hhh uh uh get rid off the baby like it's illegal or something like that but I must asumme hhh and again he tries to get rid of the baby / hhh by giving him to to an old man hhh saying him I I must assume since it is a silent movie that hhh he needs to tie him hhh the the the shoelace / and what happens is that this old mans uh uh grabbed the baby and and Charles Chaplin run away / and this man try again to get rid of the baby / by by coming across with the lady again / so we see uh hhh Charles Chaplin uh walking uh calmly through the street since he he doesn't get the the baby again hhh but the lady hhh recognising him uh uh uh she recognised him and and basically she told off / because he cannot leave the baby alone and and uh the police officer appears again / and basically uh Charles Chaplin cannot do anything a= apart from from getting the baby / hhh finally we see we we can see how how this character is basically hhh finding a letter uh with the baby who says that this baby is is and orphan and it seems that is hhh this letter is moving the character so basi= finally uh this person is uh is adopting the baby or at least hhh he is keeping the baby for a while
this extract of / the / film / is a / uh silent uh / dramatic masterpiece / starring by Charles Chaplin / who is the most famous actor / of silent films / uh the film start the scene start uh / with a xxx / starring by Charles Chaplin / who finds uh a little baby / who is a an orphan little baby / and / he / he doesn't know he doesn't know / what to do with him / so so he / doesn't want the responsibility of / take care of him / so he wants to / to to leaves him somewhere / or to leaves him in hhh / in in the street or whatever / so / uh / he decided to to to wait / but finally he / he recognize uh he realize / that / at baby the baby is / is innocent / so. so uh / uh he / he softens / uh he decided to / to take / care of him / uh the scene ends with a note / which says / uh take care of me 'n' love me / uh he decided to to adopt the baby / uh / this a scenes / uh / it's about / everything's happen everything happens / with / for a reason
